Ben has been working with clients in the digital marketing space for over 15 years.  He got his start in analytics by developing Wordpress sites for clients which quickly led to implementing analytics solutions to track the value of the digital marketing dollars his clients were spending. 

In 2008 he started his own digital analytics business managing website development projects, technical SEO audits, analytics implementation, and digital marketing analysis for over 50 different clients in a wide variety of industries. 

Since those early years, he has worked as a lead digital analyst in a rapidly growing non-profit, an analytics manager in a multi-billion dollar organization, and now as a Sr. Marketing Data Scientist.

Ben is based in the Athens, GA area with his wife, 3 boys, 2 dogs,  a cat (who hates me), 10 ducks, 25 chickens, 2 turkeys, and 5 goats.

                When the iPhones first came out I have to admit I wasn&#39;t very interested in it. I was curious about it and thought it was pretty cool but really had no use for it.  At that time I was getting emails from family and friends but never really interacted that much on the interwebs.
About 5 years ago my awesome wife bought me the new Samsung Blackjack but I ended up taking it back for a nice flip phone and save the money.

                Olive Tree&#39;s BibleReader 5.0 is out! When I turned on my iPad and brought up my Bible from [Olive Tree](http://www.olivetree.com/learningcenter/br5/) during Church I was surprised. It just wasn&#39;t the same. I finally upgraded all of my apps and therefore got the newly released BibleReader 5.0.  There are few Bible apps out there that can compare to the elegance and practicality of Olive Tree’s app.
[I’ve compared the best Bible apps for the iPad before so if you’re looking for some options you might want to check that out.

                Evernote is a personal bookmarking application. It allows you to save information from webpages, photos, receipts, or anything digital to an onine directory that you organize and manage. The desktop and mobile applications work seamlessly together with the online database. (View the intro video at the end of the article)  Evernotehas become one of the most crucial apps I am using on a daily basis. It has proven itself to be a very flexible and stable application that can mold to almost any model.

            <div class="card-text">
                I know that one of the first frustrations I came across with Doug (my iPad) was the inability to mirror the screen to a monitor. As with any relationship, working through the conflict resolution process only strengthened our bond to each other.  Little did I know that this was possible all along. :(
I always knew you could connect to a monitor or projector in some of the apps but they were few and far between.

I had no idea that it would be as easy as it was to sync it up with the iPad, it literraly is a two clicks on the iPad, five keys on the keyboard and DONE.

                Since I am the worst when it comes to having a regular time of Bible study I . I am always looking for new ways to keep me focused. That is why one of the first apps I looked for was a bible for my iPad. I found three Bible apps that have been very effective in helping me maintain an effective devotional life due to their features and options.

                I wrote and article the other week for ChurchDrop about these wodden iPad covers. My brother in Portland recently started working part time for a small wood working company called Substrata. I was skeptical of the practicality of having a hand made wood cover for my iPad but the novelty of it intrigued me. Check these photos out and then head on over to Churchdrop for more information and leave a comment.

Here are three simple things to keep in mind as you begin building your community online.

                I’ve had the opportunity to monitor the analytics for my church website for a little over two years now. Like most churches Burgess Road does not have a big budget for web development so I used Google Analytics as my main monitoring device. There are many advantages of using Google analytics but ultimately it is a program that is designed to give feedback to the business world and not the unique online property of a church or a non profit.

There are a few things that I am sure of. I have a beautiful, talented, and godly wife. My three boys keep me on my toes. And I have a God who loves me enough to start with new mercies every day.

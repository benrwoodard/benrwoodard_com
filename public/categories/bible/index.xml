      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0488.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0488.jpg)In 1 Corinthians 1 Paul explains that there should be no divisions in the church. According to Paul, the &amp;quot;wisdom of man&amp;quot; believes the gospel message is foolishness and therefore anyone who follows after the cunning words of a man&#39;s message just because it &amp;quot;makes sense&amp;quot; more than another is in the wrong.  Paul goes on to explain in chapter 2 that true wisdom in the Gospel Mesage (cross and resurrection) can only be understood through the Spirit.</description>

      <description>![Weak things of this world are strong ](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0423.jpg)It is hard to comprehend but easy to experience in our culture. The idea that the worldly system is going to naturally believe the things of God are weak is something we need to consider when we begin evaluating the impact a Biblically based teaching will have in our life.  This is not asceticism. That is a form of legalism that taught people to make themselves weak and foolish in order to &amp;ldquo;suffer&amp;rdquo; with Christ.</description>

				Grace brings everything you need with it.		</title>

      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0407.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0407.jpg)&amp;quot;For the GRACE of GOD which _was_ given you in Christ Jesus;&amp;quot; (emphasis mine)  Grace is free for us but only because of the payment that Christ made. And because it was HIM who supplied the payment we have EVERYTHING we need to live a successful God-pleasing life.
We already know that God sent His Son to redeem the World according to John 3:16. This is not exclusive to our Peace it is essential.</description>

				What constitutes a Church? According to Paul		</title>

      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0406-1.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0406-1.jpg)  According to Paul, the Church at Corinth was made up of a separated (sanctified) and called out group of people who believe (called upon the name) on Jesus Christ.
There is a lot in this one verse that should cause us to take a second look at our ideas and comfort level with our local church. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about interdenominational community, I&amp;rsquo;m referencing our view of who we are as a community in our church.</description>

				Corinth was not much unlike our culture		</title>

      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0403.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0403.jpg)The culture of first century Corinth appears to be eerily similar to our modern culture here in America. In many ways we have just changed the methods of our excessiveness and corruption but the heart has remained as bent toward distorting truth as ever.  Lest we take a &amp;ldquo;higher view&amp;rdquo; of ourselves and miss the insight of these 2 books, check carefully the mindset of your view of today&amp;rsquo;s culture and remember that we are influenced every day by the culture we live in.</description>

				Can my zeal for God turn away His wrath?		</title>

      <description>[![Rock of ages](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0389.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0389.jpg)Could my efforts save me from the punishment I deserve in my rejection of God? My sin cannot be overcome by my hands or wisdom.  This experiment of trying to save myself has been repeated and failed in every soul that has walked the earth from the beginning of time. It is impossible to please God through my hands or intentions.
Accepting the atonement of Christ&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice is the only way to escape the wrath of a Holy God.</description>

				What does the Law actually do?		</title>

It simply magnified the true nature of sin and our desperate condition of being condemned.  There is more to it though.
** **
The Law did not create Grace. Grace was always there since the Fall of Adam and Eve. Like a good school teacher, the Law shows us what was already in existence by magnifying the nature of something through a series of laws.</description>

				Our culture doesn&#39;t understand redemption: PROOF		</title>

This is free money so why does this happen?  There are a few requirements that the redemption process has in it that may hinder redeeming gift card money.
  Value must be locked up
  A code must be used to unlock the value
  The value must be used in the market it was locked up in</description>

				What the Law Cannot do, Christ did.		</title>

It doesn&#39;t know mercy or grace. It only knows justice and condemnation.  Through the Law we are able to see God&amp;rsquo;s Holiness and Glory but we also see our state of sinfulness that &amp;ldquo;falls short&amp;rdquo; of the mark. But, what the law could not do, Jesus did.
In Jesus the righteousness of the law was fulfilled. Gal. 3:13 - &amp;ldquo;Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;</description>

				Believing in God and Believing on God are 2 different things.		</title>

Abraham believed on God&amp;rsquo;s promises and it was counted as righteousness before God.
Judas believed in God but after kissing the face of God he betrayed Him.
Believing in God is one of the most fundamental aspects of our humanity. It is a natural trait that every human is born with.</description>

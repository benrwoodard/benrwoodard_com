&lt;p&gt;I’m super excited to announce that adobeanaltyicsr v0.1.5 is now available on CRAN! adobeanalyticsr is an R client for the new ‘Adobe Analytics’ API 2.0 and had a lot of great features that I believe will help data analysts do their jobs better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to make a deck of cards in R</title>

      <description>Just for the fun of it, I wanted to see how to create a complete deck of playing cards in the least amount of steps possible. Obviously, I could have just imported a premade dataset based on scraping a webpage or a csv file that someone created already but what fun would that be? So here we go!
Goal: We need to create a deck of cards that includes 4 different suits of 13 different values, and 13 different faces.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s set the stage a little here. I&amp;rsquo;m an emotional eater and when I was a struggling freelancer, I ate a lot of bad stuff. At the weight I got to, I should have been 8-9 feet tall but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t. A new job comes along and I start realizing that I&amp;rsquo;m miserable and want to change.
24 hour fitness was a mile up the road. I signed a 30 day trial and began going driving my car to the fitness place.</description>

      <description>What a great event we had at the DAA meetup. I was really looking forward to connecting with other passionate data professionals but didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to have the talks impact me like they did.
Focus was word that was verbalized in any of the conversations or talks but it was for sure a theme of the night for me. Each of the speakers were incredibly relative in their approach to the topic of pursuing your dreams in 2019.</description>

      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_0534.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_0534.jpg)Improving online behavior is a huge undertaking and this book gives the reader a head start in understanding how a few simple changes in the way we communicate online can make a big impact.  This isn&amp;rsquo;t manipulation of any kind. The data backs up the conclusions and there are some great hypothetical examples in the book.
I would recommend this book to anyone that works with online content. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely worth the read.</description>

(Gal. 3:3)  It is Jesus who is the perfection of our faith. He is the Righteousness we need and must continually rely on.
It&amp;rsquo;s not the works that we have done but the Righteousness that He Is.
What am I relying on for my relationship with God that isn&amp;rsquo;t Jesus?</description>

      <description>It was 3 years ago today that I was forced to say goodbye to a good friend. It was my first blogging community. At the helm was a kind (atleast I thought he was) and giving blogger named @tomfoolery. Then on April 1, 2010 I woke up to this horror of a blog post...  Over the past few months, I’ve had a number of awesome opportunities arise online and offline – I’m passionate about them and excited for the work I’m going to be doing.</description>

      <description>Yesterday afternoon was rather frustrating. I love what I do as a freelancer but it&#39;s not an easy job and there are some days that make it that much harder. My clients are great people. Many of them are hard-working, honest and great at what they do. It&#39;s my goal to just accent that with the work that I do.  Sometimes, though, I take on a client that becomes a bigger issue than I can afford and I have to cut ties.</description>

      <description>I received some incredible news almost 3 weeks ago but I was hesitant to say anything. I could hardly believe it was true. I even reached out to one of the organizers of the event and jokingly asked if there was an error in the emails that were sent out. There wasn&#39;t any errors and now I&#39;m listed as a speaker for this years WordCamp in ATL! Woot!  I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to WordCamp Atlanta every time they have held it since 2010.</description>

      <description>Right now I feel like someone I respected just sat me down and pointed their big ugly finger at and told me like it was. I have to explain...  I&amp;rsquo;ve had an idea for the last 18 months or more. Ever since losing my dream job at a church as the Youth/Associate/Web pastor I&amp;rsquo;ve felt the desire to create a network for web ministry volunteers and professionals where ideas could be exchanged and ministry websites could be easily built, maintained and advanced.</description>

      <description>I love whitespace more and more. When I first started evaluating the layout of my favorite websites or choosing designs for my own projects I began to realize that whitespace was a big determining factor.  It just makes things seem more&amp;hellip;awesome, somehow.

      <description>We have a [weekly parenting class](http://parentsare.us) at our church here in Summerville, SC. Currently, we are learning about AWANA and adopting the same principles that it uses to reach children to our own homes. This week we covered game time.  I know, I know&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;So what!&amp;rdquo;
Here is the part that got me. The games that we play with our kids are fun but the really good games all tend to have one thing in common.</description>

      <description>I was outside with son#2 when I set up challenge for myself. I told Matthew I was going to pitch a golf ball into the cup holder of a lawn chair from about 10 feet.
Impossible? Nope, the hole is bigger than the golf ball and I have had similar luck from 137 yards. I knew all it would take is some trial and error and plenty of chances. I began to think of the similarities between setting little challenges and setting life goals.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered how to add comments to your index page? A client wanted their visitors to be able to leave a comment on an article without having to press a link?  I&amp;rsquo;m still working through the pros and cons for this but I went ahead and added it to the site. I have to say it adds an element of UX that was not there before. Convenience is a big factor for some visitors to interact.</description>

      <description>I learned a little something this weekend about a new feature that Wordpress developed to help bloggers accomplish more in the limited time that we have. It&#39;s called &#39;Post Formats&#39; and it is a really interesting approach to content development.  The Wordpress codex (information hub for Wordpress.org) says there are several options to choose from now for styling your blog posts. For instance, sometimes you need to simply show an interesting quote.</description>

How about this: &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the worst that can happen?&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;s a phrase that has gotten many a kid in trouble at school.
Both of these phrases and so many more like them are used everyday by people trying to persuade someone else to do something that they themselves won&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>I cannot believe it has been so long since my last post. Last thing I remember I was planning to go on vacation with my family to Charleston. I figured it would allow me an opportunity to gain some ground on my article writing.  Instead of me gaining ground I have slipped back to square one, almost. What&amp;rsquo;s up with that? It feels like life has done a roundhouse kick to my forehead.</description>

      <description>A project is made up of several goals which can also be called milestones. Each milestone is comprised of simple tasks that need completing.  I have to admit that it is exciting to complete a milestone. It&amp;rsquo;s an event that I worked hard to accomplish and is a time to rejoice. Unfortunately something happens to my drive and passion as I celebrate those small victories. Everything in me that had caused me to pull the long hours and utilize every minute of the day seems to disappear.</description>

      <description>We are only one day away from [Pensacola&#39;s first 8BIT meetup](http://www.meetup.com/8bitnetwork/events/16494056/). I wanted to encourage anyone in and around Pensacola to join us for some great coffee and web ministry talk.  We are going to meet at the Drowsy Poet coffee shop on Brent Lane next to PCA at about 7:45. We have no set times but I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to leave at 9 for a doctors appointment.</description>

      <description>This is one of those moments that your going to remember where you were when you heard the news. The 8BIT network has moved their StandardTheme forums to ZenDesk from vBulletin.
I knew that the Standard Theme&amp;rsquo;s popularity as the premiere blogging theme on WordPress was growing rapidly but I never really considered the impact such growth could have on the forum systm until I spoke briefly with Chris Ames (@dewde) via email.</description>

      <description>There is a trust issue we have with online relationships. This is healthy. In light of that fact, I feel it is necessary to clear up any misunderstanding I may have with someone before it ever actually causes a conflict.  Therefore, I wanted to make very clear my intentions on this blog property. I understand that there may still arise some conflicts from the content I produce but hopefully having a clearly spelled out disclosure policy will either prevent or help solve most of them.</description>

      <description>I was on my way to a birthday party on Saturday and wanted to stop by and redeem my coupon for a free coffee at Starbucks. I pulled up to the window to get my coffee when I saw this unique way of asking for tips.  I was immediately faced with the question of choosing a team to back if I wanted to leave a tip.

As far as response goes, do you think this would this cause a positive return or limit the normal response by people like me, who don&amp;rsquo;t want to choose a team?</description>

      <description>It&#39;s begun. I&#39;ve finally begun executing an idea I have had in my head for over a year. The idea came from the frustration of trying to develop a new website for [Burgess Road](http://burgessroad.org) last spring.  Several times I came across an issue with the new site that had me seeking advice. I can remember surfing through all the other church websites in town looking for a link to a local network of web ministry pros and volunteers but I never found one.</description>

      <description>Evernote is a personal bookmarking application. It allows you to save information from webpages, photos, receipts, or anything digital to an onine directory that you organize and manage. The desktop and mobile applications work seamlessly together with the online database. (View the intro video at the end of the article)  Evernotehas become one of the most crucial apps I am using on a daily basis. It has proven itself to be a very flexible and stable application that can mold to almost any model.</description>

      <description>I have been encouraged over the past few months by witnessing several of my friends online create some incredibly valuable content. I consider it a privilege to read their posts and interact with them online.  The question that has been bugging me lately is: &amp;ldquo;Am I adding value to those I&amp;rsquo;m in contact with online?&amp;rdquo;
The internet is based on a free and open system of sharing interesting information.</description>

      <description>Recently I was showing an online service to a friend when he responded &amp;quot;Wow, those prices are really high.&amp;quot; It got me asking &amp;quot;What drives prices online?  I know that when I go to the gas station and get my $3.15 a gallon (ouch!) that the supply is lower and/or demand is greater so my per gallon price has risen by $.65 in the last three months.
If something were to magically happen and the oil drills in the gulf were to begin producing twice or three times the amount of crude oil then the price of our gas should go down.</description>

      <description>Back in high school and even into college I could sleep for 12 hours without even thinking I missed something. I would get up early every-once in a while but nothing regularly. In the summer of 2007 I began waking up an hour earlier than I needed to as an experiment. That experiment has lasted for almost four years now. I didn&#39;t need to start getting ready for work till about 7:30, since we didn&#39;t have any children in school or daycare, so I made it a point to wake up about 6:30 everyday.</description>

There isn&#39;t a &amp;quot;web standard&amp;quot; out there that determines what it takes to be called a Professional Internet Marketer so any &amp;quot;certification&amp;quot; has to be looked into and taken with a grain of salt. This course gives a large introduction into the many different aspects of web marketing such as:  It took me about a month of reading and studying in order to accomplish this goal.</description>

In chapter two Joshua sends out two men to spy out the city that God&amp;rsquo;s people must conquer before moving into the land that was promised to them.</description>

      <description>I’ve been able to spend a lot of time around my boys over the past few weeks. One of the things that impresses me the most is the desire to do great BIG things that are absolutely impossible for them to do at their young ages. My youngest is 14 months old and he is already refusing to remain the “baby”. When he sees a crowd of crazed boys outside after church he wants down so that he can join in.</description>

If I’m watching a Netflix video, searching the web on my iPad and running my laptop then the internet speed seems to drop off of the face of the earth.</description>

I thought @timschraeder did a great job of explaining some beginner points of interest for those wanting to begin or even consider the option of using text messages in their church.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to monitor the analytics for my church website for a little over two years now. Like most churches Burgess Road does not have a big budget for web development so I used Google Analytics as my main monitoring device. There are many advantages of using Google analytics but ultimately it is a program that is designed to give feedback to the business world and not the unique online property of a church or a non profit.</description>

The whole chapter is worthy of repeating but I wanted to highlight a small paragraph that I believe characterized the chapter well.</description>

      <description>I was washing windows the other morning and thought of how I would know if I was actually doing a good job at it and feel rewarded in my efforts. I came to the realization that the only way to know that i was doing a good job is by people not noticing the actual in work that I did but experiencing the effects of a job well done. I am not against any leadership making a big deal of someone putting forth good hard effort on a project but if that is all we are working for then I think we miss the purpose of doing the job.</description>

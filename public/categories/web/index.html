                Let’s set the stage a little here. I’m an emotional eater and when I was a struggling freelancer, I ate a lot of bad stuff. At the weight I got to, I should have been 8-9 feet tall but I wasn’t. A new job comes along and I start realizing that I’m miserable and want to change.
24 hour fitness was a mile up the road. I signed a 30 day trial and began going driving my car to the fitness place.

                What a great event we had at the DAA meetup. I was really looking forward to connecting with other passionate data professionals but didn’t expect to have the talks impact me like they did.
Focus was word that was verbalized in any of the conversations or talks but it was for sure a theme of the night for me. Each of the speakers were incredibly relative in their approach to the topic of pursuing your dreams in 2019.

This isn’t manipulation of any kind. The data backs up the conclusions and there are some great hypothetical examples in the book.
I would recommend this book to anyone that works with online content. It’s definitely worth the read.

(Gal. 3:3)  It is Jesus who is the perfection of our faith. He is the Righteousness we need and must continually rely on.
It’s not the works that we have done but the Righteousness that He Is.
What am I relying on for my relationship with God that isn’t Jesus?

                Yesterday afternoon was rather frustrating. I love what I do as a freelancer but it&#39;s not an easy job and there are some days that make it that much harder. My clients are great people. Many of them are hard-working, honest and great at what they do. It&#39;s my goal to just accent that with the work that I do.  Sometimes, though, I take on a client that becomes a bigger issue than I can afford and I have to cut ties.

I even reached out to one of the organizers of the event and jokingly asked if there was an error in the emails that were sent out. There wasn&#39;t any errors and now I&#39;m listed as a speaker for this years WordCamp in ATL! Woot!  I’ve been going to WordCamp Atlanta every time they have held it since 2010.

Ever since losing my dream job at a church as the Youth/Associate/Web pastor I’ve felt the desire to create a network for web ministry volunteers and professionals where ideas could be exchanged and ministry websites could be easily built, maintained and advanced.

                I was outside with son#2 when I set up challenge for myself. I told Matthew I was going to pitch a golf ball into the cup holder of a lawn chair from about 10 feet.
Impossible? Nope, the hole is bigger than the golf ball and I have had similar luck from 137 yards. I knew all it would take is some trial and error and plenty of chances. I began to think of the similarities between setting little challenges and setting life goals.

                Have you ever wondered how to add comments to your index page? A client wanted their visitors to be able to leave a comment on an article without having to press a link?  I’m still working through the pros and cons for this but I went ahead and added it to the site. I have to say it adds an element of UX that was not there before. Convenience is a big factor for some visitors to interact.

                I learned a little something this weekend about a new feature that Wordpress developed to help bloggers accomplish more in the limited time that we have. It&#39;s called &#39;Post Formats&#39; and it is a really interesting approach to content development.  The Wordpress codex (information hub for Wordpress.org) says there are several options to choose from now for styling your blog posts. For instance, sometimes you need to simply show an interesting quote.

How about this: “What’s the worst that can happen?” There’s a phrase that has gotten many a kid in trouble at school.

                A project is made up of several goals which can also be called milestones. Each milestone is comprised of simple tasks that need completing.  I have to admit that it is exciting to complete a milestone. It’s an event that I worked hard to accomplish and is a time to rejoice. Unfortunately something happens to my drive and passion as I celebrate those small victories. Everything in me that had caused me to pull the long hours and utilize every minute of the day seems to disappear.

                There is a trust issue we have with online relationships. This is healthy. In light of that fact, I feel it is necessary to clear up any misunderstanding I may have with someone before it ever actually causes a conflict.  Therefore, I wanted to make very clear my intentions on this blog property. I understand that there may still arise some conflicts from the content I produce but hopefully having a clearly spelled out disclosure policy will either prevent or help solve most of them.

Several times I came across an issue with the new site that had me seeking advice.

				What Drives Prices Online?		</h4>

                Recently I was showing an online service to a friend when he responded &#34;Wow, those prices are really high.&#34; It got me asking &#34;What drives prices online?  I know that when I go to the gas station and get my $3.15 a gallon (ouch!) that the supply is lower and/or demand is greater so my per gallon price has risen by $.65 in the last three months.
If something were to magically happen and the oil drills in the gulf were to begin producing twice or three times the amount of crude oil then the price of our gas should go down.

                Many of you know I started really trying to get my freelance SEO business ([Wingspan Marketing](http://wingspanmarketing.com/new-simple-mission-statement/)) up and running this last December.  It is fun to be able to blog about different things in SEO that I find interesting. I didn’t set any traffic goals but I saw something rather embarrassing on the analytics that I thought would be interesting. I shared it on WingspanMarketing.com.

                Back in high school and even into college I could sleep for 12 hours without even thinking I missed something. I would get up early every-once in a while but nothing regularly. In the summer of 2007 I began waking up an hour earlier than I needed to as an experiment. That experiment has lasted for almost four years now. I didn&#39;t need to start getting ready for work till about 7:30, since we didn&#39;t have any children in school or daycare, so I made it a point to wake up about 6:30 everyday.

In chapter two Joshua sends out two men to spy out the city that God’s people must conquer before moving into the land that was promised to them.

                I’ve been able to spend a lot of time around my boys over the past few weeks. One of the things that impresses me the most is the desire to do great BIG things that are absolutely impossible for them to do at their young ages. My youngest is 14 months old and he is already refusing to remain the “baby”. When he sees a crowd of crazed boys outside after church he wants down so that he can join in.

                I recently found this post in the archives of ChurchCrunch.com and figured I’d give it a shot. I’m used to going online and logging into my WordPress admin panel but that was becoming a time consuming venture since my internet speed had decreased recently. If I’m watching a Netflix video, searching the web on my iPad and running my laptop then the internet speed seems to drop off of the face of the earth.

I thought @timschraeder did a great job of explaining some beginner points of interest for those wanting to begin or even consider the option of using text messages in their church.

                I’ve had the opportunity to monitor the analytics for my church website for a little over two years now. Like most churches Burgess Road does not have a big budget for web development so I used Google Analytics as my main monitoring device. There are many advantages of using Google analytics but ultimately it is a program that is designed to give feedback to the business world and not the unique online property of a church or a non profit.

                I remember reading a book by R.A. Torrey called Talks To Men back when I had just graduated from college. In it I found the quote “A river can rise no higher than it’s source”. I know it is a natural law but it has so many spiritual applications. One such application is found here in this chapter as it relates to creativity and imagination.  The whole chapter is worthy of repeating but I wanted to highlight a small paragraph that I believe characterized the chapter well.

I came to the realization that the only way to know that i was doing a good job is by people not noticing the actual in work that I did but experiencing the effects of a job well done. I am not against any leadership making a big deal of someone putting forth good hard effort on a project but if that is all we are working for then I think we miss the purpose of doing the job.

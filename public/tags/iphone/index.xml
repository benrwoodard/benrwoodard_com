      <description>When the iPhones first came out I have to admit I wasn&#39;t very interested in it. I was curious about it and thought it was pretty cool but really had no use for it.  At that time I was getting emails from family and friends but never really interacted that much on the interwebs.
About 5 years ago my awesome wife bought me the new Samsung Blackjack but I ended up taking it back for a nice flip phone and save the money.</description>

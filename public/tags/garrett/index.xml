      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0403.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0403.jpg)The culture of first century Corinth appears to be eerily similar to our modern culture here in America. In many ways we have just changed the methods of our excessiveness and corruption but the heart has remained as bent toward distorting truth as ever.  Lest we take a &amp;ldquo;higher view&amp;rdquo; of ourselves and miss the insight of these 2 books, check carefully the mindset of your view of today&amp;rsquo;s culture and remember that we are influenced every day by the culture we live in.</description>

      <description>We are only one day away from [Pensacola&#39;s first 8BIT meetup](http://www.meetup.com/8bitnetwork/events/16494056/). I wanted to encourage anyone in and around Pensacola to join us for some great coffee and web ministry talk.  We are going to meet at the Drowsy Poet coffee shop on Brent Lane next to PCA at about 7:45. We have no set times but I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to leave at 9 for a doctors appointment.</description>

      <description>Happy Birthday Dad!  Today my dad turns 59! My dad is the type of man that ran away from home because of the &amp;ldquo;restricting&amp;rdquo; rules of my grandparents and joined the Marines. It may sound like it was a dumb reason but, a he would tell you, it was the best decision of his life. His experience in the Marines proved to him the type of man he could become.</description>

      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0407.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0407.jpg)&amp;quot;For the GRACE of GOD which _was_ given you in Christ Jesus;&amp;quot; (emphasis mine)  Grace is free for us but only because of the payment that Christ made. And because it was HIM who supplied the payment we have EVERYTHING we need to live a successful God-pleasing life.
We already know that God sent His Son to redeem the World according to John 3:16. This is not exclusive to our Peace it is essential.</description>

      <description>[![Rock of ages](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0389.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0389.jpg)Could my efforts save me from the punishment I deserve in my rejection of God? My sin cannot be overcome by my hands or wisdom.  This experiment of trying to save myself has been repeated and failed in every soul that has walked the earth from the beginning of time. It is impossible to please God through my hands or intentions.
Accepting the atonement of Christ&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice is the only way to escape the wrath of a Holy God.</description>

      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0381.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0381.jpg)The law was given to Moses and was not an introduction of sin. It simply magnified the true nature of sin and our desperate condition of being condemned.  There is more to it though.
** **
The Law did not create Grace. Grace was always there since the Fall of Adam and Eve. Like a good school teacher, the Law shows us what was already in existence by magnifying the nature of something through a series of laws.</description>

      <description>OK, it may sound horrible but it&#39;s true.  But wait! Before you start condemning me for being a child hater and a deceiver, the son of the Father of Lies, I would like to try and explain myself.
I guess I really don&amp;rsquo;t need to explain much because almost every parent in the world tells their kids something that isn&amp;rsquo;t true in order to see the child&amp;rsquo;s reaction. Right?</description>

      <description>The other weekend I made it up to Atlanta with the hopes of not only spending time with family but finally getting together with a couple of the people on twitter that have made a huge impact on my professional and personal life. It was amazing that they were even contemplating about meeting with me early Sunday morning but even more impressive was the reason that we couldn’t end up meeting up.</description>

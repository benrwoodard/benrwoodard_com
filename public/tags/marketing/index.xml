      <description>I was on my way to a birthday party on Saturday and wanted to stop by and redeem my coupon for a free coffee at Starbucks. I pulled up to the window to get my coffee when I saw this unique way of asking for tips.  I was immediately faced with the question of choosing a team to back if I wanted to leave a tip. 
As far as response goes, do you think this would this cause a positive return or limit the normal response by people like me, who don&amp;rsquo;t want to choose a team?</description>

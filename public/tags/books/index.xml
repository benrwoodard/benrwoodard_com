      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_0534.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_0534.jpg)Improving online behavior is a huge undertaking and this book gives the reader a head start in understanding how a few simple changes in the way we communicate online can make a big impact.  This isn&amp;rsquo;t manipulation of any kind. The data backs up the conclusions and there are some great hypothetical examples in the book.
I would recommend this book to anyone that works with online content. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely worth the read.</description>

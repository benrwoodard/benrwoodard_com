      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0406-1.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0406-1.jpg)  According to Paul, the Church at Corinth was made up of a separated (sanctified) and called out group of people who believe (called upon the name) on Jesus Christ.
There is a lot in this one verse that should cause us to take a second look at our ideas and comfort level with our local church. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about interdenominational community, I&amp;rsquo;m referencing our view of who we are as a community in our church.</description>

      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0403.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0403.jpg)The culture of first century Corinth appears to be eerily similar to our modern culture here in America. In many ways we have just changed the methods of our excessiveness and corruption but the heart has remained as bent toward distorting truth as ever.  Lest we take a &amp;ldquo;higher view&amp;rdquo; of ourselves and miss the insight of these 2 books, check carefully the mindset of your view of today&amp;rsquo;s culture and remember that we are influenced every day by the culture we live in.</description>

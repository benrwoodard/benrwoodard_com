      <description>Back in high school and even into college I could sleep for 12 hours without even thinking I missed something. I would get up early every-once in a while but nothing regularly. In the summer of 2007 I began waking up an hour earlier than I needed to as an experiment. That experiment has lasted for almost four years now. I didn&#39;t need to start getting ready for work till about 7:30, since we didn&#39;t have any children in school or daycare, so I made it a point to wake up about 6:30 everyday.</description>

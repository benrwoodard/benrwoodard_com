      <description>Just for the fun of it, I wanted to see how to create a complete deck of playing cards in the least amount of steps possible. Obviously, I could have just imported a premade dataset based on scraping a webpage or a csv file that someone created already but what fun would that be? So here we go!
Goal: We need to create a deck of cards that includes 4 different suits of 13 different values, and 13 different faces.</description>

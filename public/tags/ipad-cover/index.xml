      <description>I wrote and article the other week for ChurchDrop about these wodden iPad covers. My brother in Portland recently started working part time for a small wood working company called Substrata. I was skeptical of the practicality of having a hand made wood cover for my iPad but the novelty of it intrigued me. Check these photos out and then head on over to Churchdrop for more information and leave a comment.</description>

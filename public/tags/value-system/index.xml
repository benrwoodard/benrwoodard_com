      <description>When I think of all my great memories of Christmas in the past I see that my value system is greatly influenced by what happened during these short two weeks. It is kind of scary to think that my valuable memories usually begin about 5 years old. My 6-year-old is entering a stage in life that will establish what he deems as worthy of his time and effort, not just during the Christmas but for the entire year.</description>

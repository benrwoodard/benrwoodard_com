      <description>OK, it may sound horrible but it&#39;s true.  But wait! Before you start condemning me for being a child hater and a deceiver, the son of the Father of Lies, I would like to try and explain myself.
I guess I really don&amp;rsquo;t need to explain much because almost every parent in the world tells their kids something that isn&amp;rsquo;t true in order to see the child&amp;rsquo;s reaction. Right?</description>

				A Good Job		</title>

      <description>I was washing windows the other morning and thought of how I would know if I was actually doing a good job at it and feel rewarded in my efforts. I came to the realization that the only way to know that i was doing a good job is by people not noticing the actual in work that I did but experiencing the effects of a job well done. I am not against any leadership making a big deal of someone putting forth good hard effort on a project but if that is all we are working for then I think we miss the purpose of doing the job.</description>

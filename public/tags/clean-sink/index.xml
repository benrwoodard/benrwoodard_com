      <description>Did you know that Single Focus Project Management or SFPM was taught by Christ. (I&#39;m not saying He is necessarily endorsing my blog article but...)  Remember when He said that the whole Law hinged on one law?
Matthew 22:37 &amp;ldquo;Love The Lord your God with all your heart and will all you soul and with all your mind.&amp;quot;
I have to say that is a great example of what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to implement in my life, but on a very practical level.</description>

      <description>This is the first post of a series on what I&#39;m calling **&amp;quot;Single Focus Project Management&amp;quot;**  Even if you never clean a kitchen sink in your life your going to be able to relate to this principle of life. I&amp;rsquo;m going on two weeks of keeping my kitchen sink spotless. Not just well managed but completely free of dishes and junk that seems to accumulate very quickly on an hourly basis in our house.</description>

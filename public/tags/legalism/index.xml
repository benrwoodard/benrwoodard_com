      <description>![Weak things of this world are strong ](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0423.jpg)It is hard to comprehend but easy to experience in our culture. The idea that the worldly system is going to naturally believe the things of God are weak is something we need to consider when we begin evaluating the impact a Biblically based teaching will have in our life.  This is not asceticism. That is a form of legalism that taught people to make themselves weak and foolish in order to &amp;ldquo;suffer&amp;rdquo; with Christ.</description>

      <description>[![Rock of ages](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0389.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0389.jpg)Could my efforts save me from the punishment I deserve in my rejection of God? My sin cannot be overcome by my hands or wisdom.  This experiment of trying to save myself has been repeated and failed in every soul that has walked the earth from the beginning of time. It is impossible to please God through my hands or intentions.
Accepting the atonement of Christ&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice is the only way to escape the wrath of a Holy God.</description>

      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0381.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0381.jpg)The law was given to Moses and was not an introduction of sin. It simply magnified the true nature of sin and our desperate condition of being condemned.  There is more to it though.
** **
The Law did not create Grace. Grace was always there since the Fall of Adam and Eve. Like a good school teacher, the Law shows us what was already in existence by magnifying the nature of something through a series of laws.</description>

      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0407.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0407.jpg)&amp;quot;For the GRACE of GOD which _was_ given you in Christ Jesus;&amp;quot; (emphasis mine)  Grace is free for us but only because of the payment that Christ made. And because it was HIM who supplied the payment we have EVERYTHING we need to live a successful God-pleasing life.
We already know that God sent His Son to redeem the World according to John 3:16. This is not exclusive to our Peace it is essential.</description>

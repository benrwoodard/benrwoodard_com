According to Paul, the &amp;quot;wisdom of man&amp;quot; believes the gospel message is foolishness and therefore anyone who follows after the cunning words of a man&#39;s message just because it &amp;quot;makes sense&amp;quot; more than another is in the wrong.  Paul goes on to explain in chapter 2 that true wisdom in the Gospel Mesage (cross and resurrection) can only be understood through the Spirit.</description>

      <description>![Weak things of this world are strong ](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0423.jpg)It is hard to comprehend but easy to experience in our culture. The idea that the worldly system is going to naturally believe the things of God are weak is something we need to consider when we begin evaluating the impact a Biblically based teaching will have in our life.  This is not asceticism. That is a form of legalism that taught people to make themselves weak and foolish in order to &amp;ldquo;suffer&amp;rdquo; with Christ.</description>

      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0407.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0407.jpg)&amp;quot;For the GRACE of GOD which _was_ given you in Christ Jesus;&amp;quot; (emphasis mine)  Grace is free for us but only because of the payment that Christ made. And because it was HIM who supplied the payment we have EVERYTHING we need to live a successful God-pleasing life.
We already know that God sent His Son to redeem the World according to John 3:16. This is not exclusive to our Peace it is essential.</description>

				What constitutes a Church? According to Paul		</title>

      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0406-1.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0406-1.jpg)  According to Paul, the Church at Corinth was made up of a separated (sanctified) and called out group of people who believe (called upon the name) on Jesus Christ.
There is a lot in this one verse that should cause us to take a second look at our ideas and comfort level with our local church. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about interdenominational community, I&amp;rsquo;m referencing our view of who we are as a community in our church.</description>

				Corinth was not much unlike our culture		</title>

      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0403.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0403.jpg)The culture of first century Corinth appears to be eerily similar to our modern culture here in America. In many ways we have just changed the methods of our excessiveness and corruption but the heart has remained as bent toward distorting truth as ever.  Lest we take a &amp;ldquo;higher view&amp;rdquo; of ourselves and miss the insight of these 2 books, check carefully the mindset of your view of today&amp;rsquo;s culture and remember that we are influenced every day by the culture we live in.</description>

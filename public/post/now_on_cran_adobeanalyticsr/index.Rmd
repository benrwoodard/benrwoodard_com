It seems like forever ago that I started using the Adobe Analytic R package, RSiteCatalyst but it was just in 2017. The ability to work with the behavioral data outside of the walls of Analysis Workspace and Report Builder was so freeing!

I remember the feeling of excitement that tickled my head when I added the dimensions and metrics arguments to the function and pressed CNTRL+ENTER and discovered the data, just as I had imagined, was now sitting in my RStudio project waiting to do whatever I told it to do.

Well, I mean, once I was able to get it past the 1.4 API guards that didn't let more than 4 dimension out at one time.  These lords of the data would even make you add your request to a queue where it would sometimes site for days. 

Don't get me wrong, even with these governing beings lording over the data access, the value this new world of pulling data using the API brought my work was far beyond the world I lived in before. 

But, I began hearing rumors of a new world. A world where the data roamed free and could come an go when it pleased.  It would once again lift the sky of my expectations. The data could now go out with groups of an unlimited number.  The requests to play were no longer limited by the requests of all the others in the playground. 

Well, people...the world has a name and it is **Adobe Analytics 2.0**.

And the way to access this world in R is now through the new package **adobeanaltyicsr**.  With the official submission to CRAN, it is now available for all to download.

```r
install.packages('adobeanalyticsr')
```

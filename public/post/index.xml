      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s set the stage a little here. I&amp;rsquo;m an emotional eater and when I was a struggling freelancer, I ate a lot of bad stuff. At the weight I got to, I should have been 8-9 feet tall but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t. A new job comes along and I start realizing that I&amp;rsquo;m miserable and want to change.
24 hour fitness was a mile up the road. I signed a 30 day trial and began going driving my car to the fitness place.</description>

      <description>What a great event we had at the DAA meetup. I was really looking forward to connecting with other passionate data professionals but didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to have the talks impact me like they did.
Focus was word that was verbalized in any of the conversations or talks but it was for sure a theme of the night for me. Each of the speakers were incredibly relative in their approach to the topic of pursuing your dreams in 2019.</description>

      <description>Technology has become a part of ministry. On the one side you have the software ministry that makes little of the real effects of technology in local church ministry and on the other you have the ones who refuse to accept that our global-local communication ability has become apart of our culture. In the middle you find the calling of the local church to utilize the best opportunities to reach out and impact our culture.</description>

      <description>It may be 108 in the afternoon but north Texas mornings with a breeze are some of the most pleasant on earth. This morning I sat for a little bit outside and read the introduction and chapter 1 of Impossible People by Guinness.  I had some company 3 questions Guinness asks us to consider:
 Will Islam modernize peacefully in the end? Which faith or ideology will replace Marxism in China?</description>

This isn&amp;rsquo;t manipulation of any kind. The data backs up the conclusions and there are some great hypothetical examples in the book.
I would recommend this book to anyone that works with online content. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely worth the read.</description>

				The Wisdom of the Gospel (1 of 3)		</title>

According to Paul, the &amp;quot;wisdom of man&amp;quot; believes the gospel message is foolishness and therefore anyone who follows after the cunning words of a man&#39;s message just because it &amp;quot;makes sense&amp;quot; more than another is in the wrong.  Paul goes on to explain in chapter 2 that true wisdom in the Gospel Mesage (cross and resurrection) can only be understood through the Spirit.</description>

      <description>![Weak things of this world are strong ](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0423.jpg)It is hard to comprehend but easy to experience in our culture. The idea that the worldly system is going to naturally believe the things of God are weak is something we need to consider when we begin evaluating the impact a Biblically based teaching will have in our life.  This is not asceticism. That is a form of legalism that taught people to make themselves weak and foolish in order to &amp;ldquo;suffer&amp;rdquo; with Christ.</description>

And because it was HIM who supplied the payment we have EVERYTHING we need to live a successful God-pleasing life.
We already know that God sent His Son to redeem the World according to John 3:16. This is not exclusive to our Peace it is essential.</description>

				What constitutes a Church? According to Paul		</title>

There is a lot in this one verse that should cause us to take a second look at our ideas and comfort level with our local church. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about interdenominational community, I&amp;rsquo;m referencing our view of who we are as a community in our church.</description>

In many ways we have just changed the methods of our excessiveness and corruption but the heart has remained as bent toward distorting truth as ever.  Lest we take a &amp;ldquo;higher view&amp;rdquo; of ourselves and miss the insight of these 2 books, check carefully the mindset of your view of today&amp;rsquo;s culture and remember that we are influenced every day by the culture we live in.</description>

      <description>[![Rock of ages](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0389.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0389.jpg)Could my efforts save me from the punishment I deserve in my rejection of God? My sin cannot be overcome by my hands or wisdom.  This experiment of trying to save myself has been repeated and failed in every soul that has walked the earth from the beginning of time. It is impossible to please God through my hands or intentions.
Accepting the atonement of Christ&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice is the only way to escape the wrath of a Holy God.</description>

It simply magnified the true nature of sin and our desperate condition of being condemned.  There is more to it though.
** **
The Law did not create Grace. Grace was always there since the Fall of Adam and Eve. Like a good school teacher, the Law shows us what was already in existence by magnifying the nature of something through a series of laws.</description>

It doesn&#39;t know mercy or grace. It only knows justice and condemnation.  Through the Law we are able to see God&amp;rsquo;s Holiness and Glory but we also see our state of sinfulness that &amp;ldquo;falls short&amp;rdquo; of the mark. But, what the law could not do, Jesus did.
In Jesus the righteousness of the law was fulfilled. Gal. 3:13 - &amp;ldquo;Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;</description>

(Gal. 3:3)  It is Jesus who is the perfection of our faith. He is the Righteousness we need and must continually rely on.
It&amp;rsquo;s not the works that we have done but the Righteousness that He Is.
What am I relying on for my relationship with God that isn&amp;rsquo;t Jesus?</description>

Abraham believed on God&amp;rsquo;s promises and it was counted as righteousness before God.
Judas believed in God but after kissing the face of God he betrayed Him.
Believing in God is one of the most fundamental aspects of our humanity. It is a natural trait that every human is born with.</description>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>It was 3 years ago today that I was forced to say goodbye to a good friend. It was my first blogging community. At the helm was a kind (atleast I thought he was) and giving blogger named @tomfoolery. Then on April 1, 2010 I woke up to this horror of a blog post...  &#34;This is the last post for _More Than Useless_. Blogging and commenting have been a lot of fun and I really do enjoy it, but maintaining the current format of this site along with the frequency is challenging.</description>

      <description>Yesterday afternoon was rather frustrating. I love what I do as a freelancer but it&#39;s not an easy job and there are some days that make it that much harder. My clients are great people. Many of them are hard-working, honest and great at what they do. It&#39;s my goal to just accent that with the work that I do.  Sometimes, though, I take on a client that becomes a bigger issue than I can afford and I have to cut ties.</description>

      <description>I received some incredible news almost 3 weeks ago but I was hesitant to say anything. I could hardly believe it was true. I even reached out to one of the organizers of the event and jokingly asked if there was an error in the emails that were sent out. There wasn&#39;t any errors and now I&#39;m listed as a speaker for this years WordCamp in ATL! Woot!  I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to WordCamp Atlanta every time they have held it since 2010.</description>

      <description>I was looking over the biblical example of project management according to Nehemiah. If you haven&#39;t heard of this story in the Old Testament of the Bible then you are truly missing out. It is a story that begs the question &amp;quot;What can I do? I&#39;m only a(n) __________.&amp;quot; You fill in the blank. This guy was a trusted servant of the king but he was in charge of one thing, the drinks of the king.</description>

      <description>Right now I feel like someone I respected just sat me down and pointed their big ugly finger at and told me like it was. I have to explain...  I&amp;rsquo;ve had an idea for the last 18 months or more. Ever since losing my dream job at a church as the Youth/Associate/Web pastor I&amp;rsquo;ve felt the desire to create a network for web ministry volunteers and professionals where ideas could be exchanged and ministry websites could be easily built, maintained and advanced.</description>

I hadn&amp;rsquo;t either until today. The Dr was great and the 1.5 hours passed really fast. Thankfully it was just for well child checks but with 4 crazy boys in my house I am expecting to see a lot of our pediatrician in the coming years. Hopefully they won&amp;rsquo;t always end in shots and a sad 3 year old.</description>

      <description>![caden-day-1](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/caden-day-1.jpeg)  Everyday we are reminded of the tragedy and destruction that living in this fallen world brings. Hopelessness. Finality. Failure. All of these are characteristics of this world we live in.
Every once in a while though, God gives us a gift of hope and future. We see the world in a different lens when we concentrate on these gifts. It becomes a world of possibilities, bright future, and love.</description>

      <description>We have a [weekly parenting class](http://parentsare.us) at our church here in Summerville, SC. Currently, we are learning about AWANA and adopting the same principles that it uses to reach children to our own homes. This week we covered game time.  I know, I know&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;So what!&amp;rdquo;
Here is the part that got me. The games that we play with our kids are fun but the really good games all tend to have one thing in common.</description>

Impossible? Nope, the hole is bigger than the golf ball and I have had similar luck from 137 yards. I knew all it would take is some trial and error and plenty of chances. I began to think of the similarities between setting little challenges and setting life goals.</description>

      <description>When the iPhones first came out I have to admit I wasn&#39;t very interested in it. I was curious about it and thought it was pretty cool but really had no use for it.  At that time I was getting emails from family and friends but never really interacted that much on the interwebs.
About 5 years ago my awesome wife bought me the new Samsung Blackjack but I ended up taking it back for a nice flip phone and save the money.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered how to add comments to your index page? A client wanted their visitors to be able to leave a comment on an article without having to press a link?  I&amp;rsquo;m still working through the pros and cons for this but I went ahead and added it to the site. I have to say it adds an element of UX that was not there before. Convenience is a big factor for some visitors to interact.</description>

      <description>I learned a little something this weekend about a new feature that Wordpress developed to help bloggers accomplish more in the limited time that we have. It&#39;s called &#39;Post Formats&#39; and it is a really interesting approach to content development.  The Wordpress codex (information hub for Wordpress.org) says there are several options to choose from now for styling your blog posts. For instance, sometimes you need to simply show an interesting quote.</description>

How about this: &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the worst that can happen?&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;s a phrase that has gotten many a kid in trouble at school.
Both of these phrases and so many more like them are used everyday by people trying to persuade someone else to do something that they themselves won&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Last night was Monster Jam in Pensacola, Florida. It turned out to be one of the best events I&#39;ve ever taken my sons to. Every year I want to take my sons to Monster Jam but there are several things that held me back. Each one of those reservations ended up being false assumptions.  So what were my reservations? Thanks for asking! I&amp;rsquo;d love to share because I want everyone to experience what my two oldest boys and I experienced at the Monster Jam Pensacola event.</description>

      <description>Here are 3 helpful things to keep in mind when developing a new blog idea. They are simple to understand but can save you a bunch of &amp;quot;recovery&amp;quot; time.  The process of starting a personal and professional blog have many similarities in design but are fundamentally different in purpose. These are three simple considerations I have seen are important to a good and timely launch of a blog, whether personal or professional.</description>

      <description>I cannot believe it has been so long since my last post. Last thing I remember I was planning to go on vacation with my family to Charleston. I figured it would allow me an opportunity to gain some ground on my article writing.  Instead of me gaining ground I have slipped back to square one, almost. What&amp;rsquo;s up with that? It feels like life has done a roundhouse kick to my forehead.</description>

      <description>A project is made up of several goals which can also be called milestones. Each milestone is comprised of simple tasks that need completing.  I have to admit that it is exciting to complete a milestone. It&amp;rsquo;s an event that I worked hard to accomplish and is a time to rejoice. Unfortunately something happens to my drive and passion as I celebrate those small victories. Everything in me that had caused me to pull the long hours and utilize every minute of the day seems to disappear.</description>

We are going to meet at the Drowsy Poet coffee shop on Brent Lane next to PCA at about 7:45. We have no set times but I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to leave at 9 for a doctors appointment.</description>

I am blessed to even know her, let alone live in the same house with her. It is a miracle that we are friends. A true beauty and the beast story.]  I never really thought much about Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day before I met my wife. I can remember very little about this &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; day from my childhood as far as celebrations go.</description>

When I sign my name on a job application I&#39;m able to write with confidence that all the information that I put on the paper was accurate and complete.  Both of these events require you to do your best and then turn it in with a signature.</description>

      <description>Olive Tree&#39;s BibleReader 5.0 is out! When I turned on my iPad and brought up my Bible from [Olive Tree](http://www.olivetree.com/learningcenter/br5/) during Church I was surprised. It just wasn&#39;t the same. I finally upgraded all of my apps and therefore got the newly released BibleReader 5.0.  There are few Bible apps out there that can compare to the elegance and practicality of Olive Tree&amp;rsquo;s app.
[I&amp;rsquo;ve compared the best Bible apps for the iPad before so if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for some options you might want to check that out.</description>

      <description>There is a trust issue we have with online relationships. This is healthy. In light of that fact, I feel it is necessary to clear up any misunderstanding I may have with someone before it ever actually causes a conflict.  Therefore, I wanted to make very clear my intentions on this blog property. I understand that there may still arise some conflicts from the content I produce but hopefully having a clearly spelled out disclosure policy will either prevent or help solve most of them.</description>

      <description>I was on my way to a birthday party on Saturday and wanted to stop by and redeem my coupon for a free coffee at Starbucks. I pulled up to the window to get my coffee when I saw this unique way of asking for tips.  I was immediately faced with the question of choosing a team to back if I wanted to leave a tip. 
As far as response goes, do you think this would this cause a positive return or limit the normal response by people like me, who don&amp;rsquo;t want to choose a team?</description>

      <description>It&#39;s begun. I&#39;ve finally begun executing an idea I have had in my head for over a year. The idea came from the frustration of trying to develop a new website for [Burgess Road](http://burgessroad.org) last spring.  Several times I came across an issue with the new site that had me seeking advice. I can remember surfing through all the other church websites in town looking for a link to a local network of web ministry pros and volunteers but I never found one.</description>

      <description>Evernote is a personal bookmarking application. It allows you to save information from webpages, photos, receipts, or anything digital to an onine directory that you organize and manage. The desktop and mobile applications work seamlessly together with the online database. (View the intro video at the end of the article)  Evernotehas become one of the most crucial apps I am using on a daily basis. It has proven itself to be a very flexible and stable application that can mold to almost any model.</description>

      <description>Did you know that Single Focus Project Management or SFPM was taught by Christ. (I&#39;m not saying He is necessarily endorsing my blog article but...)  Remember when He said that the whole Law hinged on one law?
Matthew 22:37 &amp;ldquo;Love The Lord your God with all your heart and will all you soul and with all your mind.&amp;rdquo;
I have to say that is a great example of what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to implement in my life, but on a very practical level.</description>

      <description>I have been encouraged over the past few months by witnessing several of my friends online create some incredibly valuable content. I consider it a privilege to read their posts and interact with them online.  The question that has been bugging me lately is: &amp;ldquo;Am I adding value to those I&amp;rsquo;m in contact with online?&amp;rdquo;
The internet is based on a free and open system of sharing interesting information.</description>

      <description>I know that one of the first frustrations I came across with Doug (my iPad) was the inability to mirror the screen to a monitor. As with any relationship, working through the conflict resolution process only strengthened our bond to each other.  Little did I know that this was possible all along. :(
I always knew you could connect to a monitor or projector in some of the apps but they were few and far between.</description>

I know that when I go to the gas station and get my $3.15 a gallon (ouch!) that the supply is lower and/or demand is greater so my per gallon price has risen by $.65 in the last three months.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m in the process of looking for a position doing internet marketing or web development. It becomes very frustrating sometimes when I have no control over any company&#39;s vetting process.  I know that many times it has absolutely nothing to do with who I am or what I&amp;rsquo;ve submitted that the company doesn&amp;rsquo;t choose me, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from blaming myself sometimes.
If a company decides to go another way it must have been something I did.</description>

      <description>Back in high school and even into college I could sleep for 12 hours without even thinking I missed something. I would get up early every-once in a while but nothing regularly. In the summer of 2007 I began waking up an hour earlier than I needed to as an experiment. That experiment has lasted for almost four years now. I didn&#39;t need to start getting ready for work till about 7:30, since we didn&#39;t have any children in school or daycare, so I made it a point to wake up about 6:30 everyday.</description>

Not just well managed but completely free of dishes and junk that seems to accumulate very quickly on an hourly basis in our house.</description>

      <description>Sometimes the hardest part of accomplishing a goal is simply not quitting. Life gets overwhelming very quickly. One story in scripture that has meant the most to me in times of major events is found in 1 Kings 18. Elijah, a prophet of God, is brought to his knees in self pity and feelings of being overwhelmed. At one point he asks for God to take his life.  By nature we humans can become overwhelmed in a situation and begin to withdraw.</description>

      <description>...minus the party.  We were privileged to have both our sets of parents down this past holiday season. One came in during Thanksgiving and and one during Christmas. It was great to share our boys with them but I know they felt like they were in the middle of a hurricane when all three were at the top of their game.
It was also the first time that I was home and totally focused (I had no where to go) on the boys for two weeks without school to break things up.</description>

      <description>There are certain times in life where something so simple is just overlooked by the wisest and smartest of us all. Following an extremely simple command can make a world of difference in life. Here is a short list of phrases I have learned can make or break a situation.   Keep your head down (golf)
 Keep your eye on the ball (baseball)

      <description>My in-laws came down yesterday with some late Christmas presents. Among the packages was a little box that held one of the greatest accessaries known to man...THE WIRELESS KEYBOARD! (insert echo)  So it&amp;rsquo;s everything that I thought and more. I had no idea that it would be as easy as it was to sync it up with the iPad, it literraly is a two clicks on the iPad, five keys on the keyboard and DONE.</description>

      <description>When I think of all my great memories of Christmas in the past I see that my value system is greatly influenced by what happened during these short two weeks. It is kind of scary to think that my valuable memories usually begin about 5 years old. My 6-year-old is entering a stage in life that will establish what he deems as worthy of his time and effort, not just during the Christmas but for the entire year.</description>

      <description>My friend Steve doesn’t like social networks. He laughs at me every time I pull my phone out to tweet something. He made his first movie that he said I helped influence. Check it out…

      <description>Early this morning I passed my last test to be [certified as a Professional Internet Marketer](http://www.seo-training-course.com/certificate.php?id=46993918.) from [Web CEO](http://webceo.com). There isn&#39;t a &amp;quot;web standard&amp;quot; out there that determines what it takes to be called a Professional Internet Marketer so any &amp;quot;certification&amp;quot; has to be looked into and taken with a grain of salt. This course gives a large introduction into the many different aspects of web marketing such as:  search engine optimization, website optimization, search engine marketing, social media marketing, email marketing, pay per click marketing, web analytics, etc&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Since I am the worst when it comes to having a regular time of Bible study I . I am always looking for new ways to keep me focused. That is why one of the first apps I looked for was a bible for my iPad. I found three Bible apps that have been very effective in helping me maintain an effective devotional life due to their features and options.</description>

      <description>Debbie and I actually got to go out on a date and we didn’t waste the evening. We went to see Narnia: the Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The story line involves the two younger siblings and their annoying cousin. It begins and ends on the seas of Narnia. Lucy and Edmund find themselves in the water being picked up by King Caspian and the crew of the Dawn Treader who are actively seeking to find out what happened to 7 lords of Narnia.</description>

      <description>OK, it may sound horrible but it&#39;s true.  But wait! Before you start condemning me for being a child hater and a deceiver, the son of the Father of Lies, I would like to try and explain myself.
I guess I really don&amp;rsquo;t need to explain much because almost every parent in the world tells their kids something that isn&amp;rsquo;t true in order to see the child&amp;rsquo;s reaction. Right?</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been busy over the last few weeks (to say the least) on a few projects that will hopefully turn into BIGGER things. First of all it has been incredible staying home with my boys, they are fast becoming my biggest support group on the planet. Recently though I asked them if they liked me staying home. My 6 year old came over to me and gave me a hug while telling me that he missed mommy being home more.</description>

      <description>It was almost 4 weeks ago that I killed my blog. I was messing around with my live Wordpress blog when I got curious one night as to what would happen if I changed the root structure. I found out. There are several lessons I have learned over the last few weeks that I would like to try and document. The first lesson has me scratching me head a little.</description>

      <description>I’m continuing a study through the book of Joshua on Success in web ministry. Chapter one begins with one simple fact, God wants you to prosper in this life! So what I’d like to do is try to do is see how this relates to web ministry.
“For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.”    In chapter two Joshua sends out two men to spy out the city that God&amp;rsquo;s people must conquer before moving into the land that was promised to them.</description>

      <description>I wrote and article the other week for ChurchDrop about these wodden iPad covers. My brother in Portland recently started working part time for a small wood working company called Substrata. I was skeptical of the practicality of having a hand made wood cover for my iPad but the novelty of it intrigued me. Check these photos out and then head on over to Churchdrop for more information and leave a comment.</description>

      <description>I’ve been able to spend a lot of time around my boys over the past few weeks. One of the things that impresses me the most is the desire to do great BIG things that are absolutely impossible for them to do at their young ages. My youngest is 14 months old and he is already refusing to remain the “baby”. When he sees a crowd of crazed boys outside after church he wants down so that he can join in.</description>

      <description>The other weekend I made it up to Atlanta with the hopes of not only spending time with family but finally getting together with a couple of the people on twitter that have made a huge impact on my professional and personal life. It was amazing that they were even contemplating about meeting with me early Sunday morning but even more impressive was the reason that we couldn’t end up meeting up.</description>

      <description>I recently found this post in the archives of ChurchCrunch.com and figured I’d give it a shot. I’m used to going online and logging into my WordPress admin panel but that was becoming a time consuming venture since my internet speed had decreased recently. If I’m watching a Netflix video, searching the web on my iPad and running my laptop then the internet speed seems to drop off of the face of the earth.</description>

      <description>[ M2Live](http://www.m2live.org/) did it again. I was able to take part in the monthly @M2_Live webinar for October.  I wasn’t quite sure what to expect since the topic was on texting but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it really opened up my mind to yet another way to communicate with our Church members and visitors via technology.
I thought @timschraeder did a great job of explaining some beginner points of interest for those wanting to begin or even consider the option of using text messages in their church.</description>

      <description>I’ve talked several people recently that have asked the same question: “How do you get followers on twitter?” I don’t have a huge following on Twitter but I’ve built a very specific community in it that has been a huge help to me over the last year. “So how did I build that community?” _thanks for asking. _
Here are three simple things to keep in mind as you begin building your community online.</description>

				Church Analytics: my take		</title>

      <guid>/2010-10-03-church-analytics/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to monitor the analytics for my church website for a little over two years now. Like most churches Burgess Road does not have a big budget for web development so I used Google Analytics as my main monitoring device. There are many advantages of using Google analytics but ultimately it is a program that is designed to give feedback to the business world and not the unique online property of a church or a non profit.</description>

      <description>I remember reading a book by R.A. Torrey called Talks To Men back when I had just graduated from college. In it I found the quote “A river can rise no higher than it’s source”. I know it is a natural law but it has so many spiritual applications. One such application is found here in this chapter as it relates to creativity and imagination.  The whole chapter is worthy of repeating but I wanted to highlight a small paragraph that I believe characterized the chapter well.</description>

      <description>I was washing windows the other morning and thought of how I would know if I was actually doing a good job at it and feel rewarded in my efforts. I came to the realization that the only way to know that i was doing a good job is by people not noticing the actual in work that I did but experiencing the effects of a job well done. I am not against any leadership making a big deal of someone putting forth good hard effort on a project but if that is all we are working for then I think we miss the purpose of doing the job.</description>

      <description>Recently I began my adventure into the world of freelancers. It can be a very scary place but also very exciting. I am currently looking for small time web development work on Craigslist so I have subscribed to the Craigslist local listings and saw this comment by someone looking for some programming work done on his site. I know that educating the client is part of the gig and this dispute that played out is a perfect example.</description>

      <description>I believe Netflix is allowing us parents to bridge the generational gap like no other resource outside of the church.  Here is one of my favorites as a kid and I was able to introduce it today to my kids via Netflix. High five for the interwebs!Do you think it is necessary for dads to try and bridge some of the generational gap with their kids?</description>

By the way, I just learned that I can very easily take a screen-shot of my iPad by holding down the top button and then pushing the round button for a moment. The screen flashes white and it&amp;rsquo;s done. Simply go to your photos and there it is. For more detailed help check out this article.</description>

My dad is the type of man that ran away from home because of the &amp;ldquo;restricting&amp;rdquo; rules of my grandparents and joined the Marines. It may sound like it was a dumb reason but, a he would tell you, it was the best decision of his life. His experience in the Marines proved to him the type of man he could become.</description>

      <description>This blog is all about starting from a clean slate. I thought that by 32 I would have a pretty good idea of what I was suppose do be doing career wise but...  There are a few things that I am sure of. I have a beautiful, talented, and godly wife. My three boys keep me on my toes. And I have a God who loves me enough to start with new mercies every day.</description>

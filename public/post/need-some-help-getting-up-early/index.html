I would get up early every-once in a while but nothing regularly.  In the summer of 2007 I began waking up an hour earlier than I needed to as an experiment. That experiment has lasted for almost four years now.  I didn't need to start getting ready for work till about 7:30, since we didn't have any children in school or daycare, so I made it a point to wake up about 6:30 everyday.  This went great.  I was able to get a lot done before anyone got up and my devotional quiet time improved along with my productivity for that day.
</code></pre>
<p>I have slowly moved this time earlier and earlier.  For the past 3 months or so I have been trying to wake up most days about 4:30.  This has been such an incredible opportunity to getting a lot of the housework and web work done.  I&rsquo;ve been able to learn a ton through spending those quiet hours before 6:15 when I have to start getting ready.  Sure there are some days that I can &rsquo;t seem to pull myself out of bed but at least 4 times a week you will find me out at the dining room table working on something by 4:15-4:30.  Here are three simple tips I have learned along the way that may help you to wake up earlier than you need to.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Reward</strong>
This may seem childish to some but it motivates me to think of something that I can have if I get up by a certain time.  Most of the time this is a <strong>special breakfast or coffee</strong>.  I love sitting in our dining room looking out the windows as the sun comes up over the field we have behind our fence.  The more I want, whatever it is, the more likely I&rsquo;m going to wake up.
<strong>Alarms</strong>
Some nights I&rsquo;m up till 12 or 2 working on a project so waking up after only 3 or 4 hours is hard to do. I have tried several different alarms and most will get my attention out of any level of sleep but my problem lies when I can simply roll over and just hit snooze.  The answer to this (as many know) is to simply <strong>move the alarm</strong> away so that you have to actually get out of bed to turn it off. Like I said before, I don&rsquo;t always wake up this early so when I have a few days of only getting 2 to 3 hours sleep I take a short nap in the afternoon with the kids or sleep longer the next night.
<strong>Quiet</strong>
I guess this is kind of a reward but only people with kids or roommates will be able to relate so I left it in a different section.  I have three incredibly active young boys (Ryan 6, Matthew 4, and Garrett 18 months).  They wake up every morning between 6:30 and 7:00.  I have to be prepared for when they get up or my day quickly becomes a mess.  I need my quiet time to <strong>organize my thoughts</strong> for the day and possibly get some thinking done.</p>
<p>I know many people get up early (when they aren&rsquo;t being forced too) everyday.  What types of things help you get up and get going in the morning?</p>

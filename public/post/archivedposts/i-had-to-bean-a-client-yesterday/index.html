I love what I do as a freelancer but it's not an easy job and there are some days that make it that much harder.  My clients are great people.  Many of them are hard-working, honest and great at what they do.  It's my goal to just accent that with the work that I do.  
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes, though, I take on a client that becomes a bigger issue than I can afford and I have to cut ties.  I recently had one of those &lsquo;clients&rsquo; and it didn&rsquo;t end well.  I did everything I could to try to work with them but unfortunately we just couldn&rsquo;t seem to get on the same page.  It came down to a matter of blind expectations that I would work more hours than what we agreed to.  I let my judgement slide and continued to work the extra hours hoping the client would see the value I was bringing to the table.  In return he increase my pay to match the hours, but as usual, this didn&rsquo;t happen.  He saw the extra work as just part of the gig. Therefore he never saw the value.  The big drawback in going through this and trying to make his business a success was that my business suffered.</p>
<p>I learned a long time ago when I was in full-time ministry that you had to set up guards in your life that would prevent someone who couldn&rsquo;t control their own life to control yours.  This same rule applies to my freelance business as well. I can&rsquo;t let a failing business that is out of control take me down with them.  I already stopped investing in businesses but now I need to reconsider my vision for &ldquo;saving&rdquo; businesses.  I guess I needed to learn this lesson the hard way because I let my guard down and took a huge hit in the process.</p>

After speaking with the client and finding out just how big of a hit my family and I were going to take this month, I had to go for a jog.  (It was a short jog since I hadn&rsquo;t gone for a jog in over a year.)</p>
<p>While on the jog I called my dad who had been in sales most of his career.  He understands what it means to &lsquo;take a hit&rsquo; because of an unreasonable client.</p>
<p>His advice was simple: &ldquo;Bean him&rdquo;</p>
<p>My response was the same as yours probably.  &ldquo;Bean him? What does that mean.&rdquo;  My dad went on to explain that while working in sales he would carry beans in his pocket.  When a client would treat him wrong or things just weren&rsquo;t working out in the relationship, he would reach in his pocket while walking to his car and throw a bean.  It was his way of shrugging it off. He said, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t let it bother you or the rest of your business will go down with this one client.  You&rsquo;ve got to get past it and move on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Easy for your to say, I thought.  So I pleaded my case explaining how much of a sleezeball the client was for misleading me through bonuses and pay increases that never happened. My argument continued with myself while my dad was listening and only took a breath after saying &ldquo;How can he be such a sleezeball!?&rdquo; My dad responded with the words that would allow me to move on, &ldquo;He may be a sleezeball but you found him.&rdquo;  I couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my responsibility as a freelancer and business owner to choose wisely and keep my guard up.</p>
<p>So I beaned a client yesterday.  I&rsquo;m finished, I learned some valuable lessons and the future is looking good.</p>
<p>One last thing to remember is that although I may have some immediate issues with bills and such, I&rsquo;ve got a rich and loving heavenly Father who is going to take care of me and my family.  :)</p>

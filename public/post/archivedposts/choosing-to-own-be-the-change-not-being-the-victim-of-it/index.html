At the weight I got to, I should have been 8-9 feet tall but I wasn&rsquo;t.  A new job comes along and I start realizing that I&rsquo;m miserable and want to change.</p>
<p>24 hour fitness was a mile up the road.  I signed a 30 day trial and began going driving my car to the fitness place.  I did this about a week and then realized I had a bike and could get there more easily and with more effort (the entire point of going to the gym) by riding my bike.  So that is what I did.  I&rsquo;d leave my bike infront of the garage every night.</p>
<p>It was bout day 5 of this when I walked out of my house early in the morning, looked at the garage door where I left my bike and didn&rsquo;t see it.  It was STOLEN!!!</p>
<p>I wish I could say I do this everytime but I have to admit I don&rsquo;t.  The thought crossed my mind that I would just run to the fitness center.  At first I was angry but I quickly realized that this was going to be great.  Now I was running 2 miles (up and back) and getting in some weights as well.</p>
<p>That was it, I was hooked and ended up averaging 20-25 miles a week within a 6 month period after my bike was stolen.  It has physically changed my life.  I hope to meet this theif one day and thank him for his help.</p>
<p>As I said before, I wish I responded this way and with as much quickness everytime in these type of situations but alas, I don&rsquo;t.  In fact, most times I complain to others around me and bring in the drama.  It&rsquo;s my way of looking for confirmation that I was wronged.  Every once in a while, I&rsquo;ll be sharing my victimization with someone and they&rsquo;ll just look at me weird or have the kindness to call me out on my attitude.</p>
<p>I must say I appreciate that response from my family and friends.  Maybe not immediately but it doesn&rsquo;t take line and I begin to see clearly why they felt the need to address it with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing my stolen bike story because I believe I have been sulking over a victim scenario over the last 12 months and it&rsquo;s time to start running.  I&rsquo;m going to lead the change not play the victim to it or it&rsquo;s nasty brother, no change.</p>
<p>I need to look at my life&rsquo;s challenges and face them as they truly are, my challenges. These are not someone elses responsibility right now. I&rsquo;m the one who needs to initiate the change. Right or wrong (I&rsquo;d prefer Right) I am responsible to bring out the change.</p>
<p>My bike was stolen so you&rsquo;ll find me running on the side of the road.</p>

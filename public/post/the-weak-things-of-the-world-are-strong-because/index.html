<p>This is not asceticism. That is a form of legalism that taught people to make themselves weak and foolish in order to &ldquo;suffer&rdquo; with Christ. Apparently, the self inflicted pain and suffering should add to the grace that Christ provided. This self abasement is not what Paul is referring to here.</p>
<p>This is in reference to the humility that walking a surrendered Christian life requires in order to experience God&rsquo;s amazing power and love in your life. Humility says that we don&rsquo;t know everything. It also says that He does and we can trust Him with our whole heart.</p>
<p>Keeping these ideas in mind, we can see why Paul begins his book to the Corinthians attempting to provide a path to unity. The first insight is for us as Christians to realize that our source for wisdom and strength is God, not man. We also need to remember that we are influenced by the world all the time and should check ourselves regularly.</p>

There is a lot in this one verse that should cause us to take a second look at our ideas and comfort level with our local church. I’m not talking about interdenominational community, I’m referencing our view of who we are as a community in our church.

In many ways we have just changed the methods of our excessiveness and corruption but the heart has remained as bent toward distorting truth as ever.  Lest we take a “higher view” of ourselves and miss the insight of these 2 books, check carefully the mindset of your view of today’s culture and remember that we are influenced every day by the culture we live in.

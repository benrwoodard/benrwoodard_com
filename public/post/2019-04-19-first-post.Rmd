# I really like writing this.

Have you ever had these 3 things happen to you?

1. get a call
2. take a train ride
3. Somethingt else that is 3rd

## This is the second mose important point

### And finally this is the last part of it all.

`r 2+3` is the answer to 2 + 3.

![intro image](/post/2019-04-19-first-post_files/IMG_1593.JPG)

```{r, firstvisual,include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data("mtcars")
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(mpg,hp, color=rownames(mtcars))) + geom_point()
```



This is it. the end.

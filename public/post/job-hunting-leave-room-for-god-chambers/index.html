<p>I know that many times it has absolutely nothing to do with who I am or what I&rsquo;ve submitted that the company doesn&rsquo;t choose me, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop me from blaming myself sometimes.</p>
<p>If a company decides to go another way it must have been something I did. Right?</p>

<p><strong>WRONG!</strong></p>
<p>Oswald Chambers quotes from Galatians 1:15 &ldquo;But when it pleased God&hellip;&rdquo; and then encourages us to &ldquo;leave room for God&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t leave room for Him in these decisions we will easily slip into a phase of bitterness or discouragement. And when all is said and done we can even begin to question the <strong>&ldquo;Goodness&rdquo; of God</strong>.</p>
<p>I have to say, through this whole job hunting process I have been in every one of those phases at least once.</p>
<p>Chambers comments made me think of times when I guide my children indirectly without them noticing.  When my sons have some money we will take them to a Dollar General or something and let them &ldquo;pick&rdquo; out a toy.</p>
<p>The boys will walk up and down the aisle checking things out with excitement and anticipation.</p>
<p>If you have ever been standing beside a young boy in a toy aisle you know what I&rsquo;m talking about. The <strong>anticipation</strong> of purchasing a toy almost brings them into convulsions.  They pick up the toy and <strong>imagine</strong> the multitude of ways they will play with it.</p>
<p>What they don&rsquo;t realize, is that I&rsquo;m looking at the toys with them and determining which ones I know they will actually play with (I know my boys) and which ones they could easily break.</p>
<p>I gently turn their attention onto the toys that I deem appropriate, safe, and durable.  Most of the time they have no clue that they are walking out of the store with a toy that I chose for them.  This is good parenting.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a few time there has arisen a conflict.  Usually this is with my 6 year old (Ryan).  He is becoming wise to my <em>&ldquo;guidance&rdquo;</em> and begins to protest my <em>&ldquo;persuasive&rdquo;</em> ways.</p>
<p>This commences a struggle of the wills that will usually end with him either grumpily getting the toy I pick out or nothing at all.</p>
<p>If I do it right, he doesn&rsquo;t know any different and purchases the &ldquo;best&rdquo; toy out of an aisle of junk.</p>
<p>If I do it wrong, and expose my plans of manipulation, he is angry with me and feels I&rsquo;m not letting him get the toy because I don&rsquo;t understand or that I&rsquo;m just being unfair.  (note: God doesn&rsquo;t manipulate because he is sovereign, unfortunately I am not.  God simply <em>guides and directs</em>.</p>
<p>These feelings come because Ryan thinks he <strong>knows best</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the same way I see my response to my Savior.  While looking for a job or a way to further my education I can see how awesome it would be to &ldquo;live here&rdquo; or &ldquo;do that&rdquo;.  Sometimes I can take offense to God closing the door.</p>
<p>I can become discouraged by feeling that I&rsquo;m not good enough or that I didn&rsquo;t do something the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way.</p>
<p>Much like my boys in an aisle of toys ready to purchase, I&rsquo;m excited about what God has in-store for my family and me.  I know our next move is going to be exciting.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m asking God for the job I want but will also ask that God  please give me the ability to &ldquo;leave room for You&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Do you have any encouraging stories of God guiding a certain way when you thought another way would be better?  How did it turn out?  How did you know?</p>
<p>I would love to hear about it.</p>

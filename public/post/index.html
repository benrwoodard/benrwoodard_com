                I want to make a deck of cards. Here is how I do it.
First we need to understand the elements of the deck of cards. There are 4 different suits, 13 different values, and 13 different faces.
Make the suits in order by naming the four suits and listing them 13 times so that all 3 lists are the same length.
 Make the faces by listing out all 13 and we can duplicate it from there.

                Seeing the proportion of the whole is a valuable visualization when looking at different segments. Recently I was asked to explore the differences between two audiences and using the proportion charts were incredibly telling. The ability to quickly identify if there could be differences between two groups and then identify what the difference is, can help anyone in their data exploration process in addition to telling the story.

                Let’s set the stage a little here. I’m an emotional eater and when I was a struggling freelancer, I ate a lot of bad stuff. At the weight I got to, I should have been 8-9 feet tall but I wasn’t. A new job comes along and I start realizing that I’m miserable and want to change.
24 hour fitness was a mile up the road. I signed a 30 day trial and began going driving my car to the fitness place.

                What a great event we had at the DAA meetup. I was really looking forward to connecting with other passionate data professionals but didn’t expect to have the talks impact me like they did.
Focus was word that was verbalized in any of the conversations or talks but it was for sure a theme of the night for me. Each of the speakers were incredibly relative in their approach to the topic of pursuing your dreams in 2019.

                Technology has become a part of ministry. On the one side you have the software ministry that makes little of the real effects of technology in local church ministry and on the other you have the ones who refuse to accept that our global-local communication ability has become apart of our culture. In the middle you find the calling of the local church to utilize the best opportunities to reach out and impact our culture.

This isn’t manipulation of any kind. The data backs up the conclusions and there are some great hypothetical examples in the book.
I would recommend this book to anyone that works with online content. It’s definitely worth the read.

According to Paul, the &#34;wisdom of man&#34; believes the gospel message is foolishness and therefore anyone who follows after the cunning words of a man&#39;s message just because it &#34;makes sense&#34; more than another is in the wrong.  Paul goes on to explain in chapter 2 that true wisdom in the Gospel Mesage (cross and resurrection) can only be understood through the Spirit.

The idea that the worldly system is going to naturally believe the things of God are weak is something we need to consider when we begin evaluating the impact a Biblically based teaching will have in our life.  This is not asceticism. That is a form of legalism that taught people to make themselves weak and foolish in order to “suffer” with Christ.

There is a lot in this one verse that should cause us to take a second look at our ideas and comfort level with our local church. I’m not talking about interdenominational community, I’m referencing our view of who we are as a community in our church.

In many ways we have just changed the methods of our excessiveness and corruption but the heart has remained as bent toward distorting truth as ever.  Lest we take a “higher view” of ourselves and miss the insight of these 2 books, check carefully the mindset of your view of today’s culture and remember that we are influenced every day by the culture we live in.

Accepting the atonement of Christ’s sacrifice is the only way to escape the wrath of a Holy God.

It simply magnified the true nature of sin and our desperate condition of being condemned.  There is more to it though.

The Law did not create Grace. Grace was always there since the Fall of Adam and Eve. Like a good school teacher, the Law shows us what was already in existence by magnifying the nature of something through a series of laws.

Judas believed in God but after kissing the face of God he betrayed Him.
Believing in God is one of the most fundamental aspects of our humanity. It is a natural trait that every human is born with.

                It was 3 years ago today that I was forced to say goodbye to a good friend. It was my first blogging community. At the helm was a kind (atleast I thought he was) and giving blogger named @tomfoolery. Then on April 1, 2010 I woke up to this horror of a blog post...  Over the past few months, I’ve had a number of awesome opportunities arise online and offline – I’m passionate about them and excited for the work I’m going to be doing.

                Yesterday afternoon was rather frustrating. I love what I do as a freelancer but it&#39;s not an easy job and there are some days that make it that much harder. My clients are great people. Many of them are hard-working, honest and great at what they do. It&#39;s my goal to just accent that with the work that I do.  Sometimes, though, I take on a client that becomes a bigger issue than I can afford and I have to cut ties.

There wasn&#39;t any errors and now I&#39;m listed as a speaker for this years WordCamp in ATL! Woot!  I’ve been going to WordCamp Atlanta every time they have held it since 2010.

I’ve had an idea for the last 18 months or more. Ever since losing my dream job at a church as the Youth/Associate/Web pastor I’ve felt the desire to create a network for web ministry volunteers and professionals where ideas could be exchanged and ministry websites could be easily built, maintained and advanced.

I hadn’t either until today. The Dr was great and the 1.5 hours passed really fast. Thankfully it was just for well child checks but with 4 crazy boys in my house I am expecting to see a lot of our pediatrician in the coming years. Hopefully they won’t always end in shots and a sad 3 year old.

Every once in a while though, God gives us a gift of hope and future. We see the world in a different lens when we concentrate on these gifts. It becomes a world of possibilities, bright future, and love.

Impossible? Nope, the hole is bigger than the golf ball and I have had similar luck from 137 yards. I knew all it would take is some trial and error and plenty of chances. I began to think of the similarities between setting little challenges and setting life goals.

                When the iPhones first came out I have to admit I wasn&#39;t very interested in it. I was curious about it and thought it was pretty cool but really had no use for it.  At that time I was getting emails from family and friends but never really interacted that much on the interwebs.
About 5 years ago my awesome wife bought me the new Samsung Blackjack but I ended up taking it back for a nice flip phone and save the money.

                Have you ever wondered how to add comments to your index page? A client wanted their visitors to be able to leave a comment on an article without having to press a link?  I’m still working through the pros and cons for this but I went ahead and added it to the site. I have to say it adds an element of UX that was not there before. Convenience is a big factor for some visitors to interact.

                I learned a little something this weekend about a new feature that Wordpress developed to help bloggers accomplish more in the limited time that we have. It&#39;s called &#39;Post Formats&#39; and it is a really interesting approach to content development.  The Wordpress codex (information hub for Wordpress.org) says there are several options to choose from now for styling your blog posts. For instance, sometimes you need to simply show an interesting quote.

I recently had a chance to speak, via email, to Michael Novotny about his role in the forums of Standard Theme. I’ve taken several of his comments and will use them to give you a simple guide to get the most out of your forum experience.

How about this: “What’s the worst that can happen?” There’s a phrase that has gotten many a kid in trouble at school.
Both of these phrases and so many more like them are used everyday by people trying to persuade someone else to do something that they themselves won’t.

Thanks for asking! I’d love to share because I want everyone to experience what my two oldest boys and I experienced at the Monster Jam Pensacola event.

                A project is made up of several goals which can also be called milestones. Each milestone is comprised of simple tasks that need completing.  I have to admit that it is exciting to complete a milestone. It’s an event that I worked hard to accomplish and is a time to rejoice. Unfortunately something happens to my drive and passion as I celebrate those small victories. Everything in me that had caused me to pull the long hours and utilize every minute of the day seems to disappear.

                There is a trust issue we have with online relationships. This is healthy. In light of that fact, I feel it is necessary to clear up any misunderstanding I may have with someone before it ever actually causes a conflict.  Therefore, I wanted to make very clear my intentions on this blog property. I understand that there may still arise some conflicts from the content I produce but hopefully having a clearly spelled out disclosure policy will either prevent or help solve most of them.

                I was on my way to a birthday party on Saturday and wanted to stop by and redeem my coupon for a free coffee at Starbucks. I pulled up to the window to get my coffee when I saw this unique way of asking for tips.  I was immediately faced with the question of choosing a team to back if I wanted to leave a tip.

As far as response goes, do you think this would this cause a positive return or limit the normal response by people like me, who don’t want to choose a team?

                It&#39;s begun. I&#39;ve finally begun executing an idea I have had in my head for over a year. The idea came from the frustration of trying to develop a new website for [Burgess Road](http://burgessroad.org) last spring.  Several times I came across an issue with the new site that had me seeking advice. I can remember surfing through all the other church websites in town looking for a link to a local network of web ministry pros and volunteers but I never found one.

                Evernote is a personal bookmarking application. It allows you to save information from webpages, photos, receipts, or anything digital to an onine directory that you organize and manage. The desktop and mobile applications work seamlessly together with the online database. (View the intro video at the end of the article)  Evernotehas become one of the most crucial apps I am using on a daily basis. It has proven itself to be a very flexible and stable application that can mold to almost any model.

Matthew 22:37 “Love The Lord your God with all your heart and will all you soul and with all your mind.&#34;

                I know that one of the first frustrations I came across with Doug (my iPad) was the inability to mirror the screen to a monitor. As with any relationship, working through the conflict resolution process only strengthened our bond to each other.  Little did I know that this was possible all along. :(
I always knew you could connect to a monitor or projector in some of the apps but they were few and far between.

                Recently I was showing an online service to a friend when he responded &#34;Wow, those prices are really high.&#34; It got me asking &#34;What drives prices online?  I know that when I go to the gas station and get my $3.15 a gallon (ouch!) that the supply is lower and/or demand is greater so my per gallon price has risen by $.65 in the last three months.
If something were to magically happen and the oil drills in the gulf were to begin producing twice or three times the amount of crude oil then the price of our gas should go down.

                I&#39;m in the process of looking for a position doing internet marketing or web development. It becomes very frustrating sometimes when I have no control over any company&#39;s vetting process.  I know that many times it has absolutely nothing to do with who I am or what I’ve submitted that the company doesn’t choose me, but that doesn’t stop me from blaming myself sometimes.
If a company decides to go another way it must have been something I did.

                Back in high school and even into college I could sleep for 12 hours without even thinking I missed something. I would get up early every-once in a while but nothing regularly. In the summer of 2007 I began waking up an hour earlier than I needed to as an experiment. That experiment has lasted for almost four years now. I didn&#39;t need to start getting ready for work till about 7:30, since we didn&#39;t have any children in school or daycare, so I made it a point to wake up about 6:30 everyday.

                Sometimes the hardest part of accomplishing a goal is simply not quitting. Life gets overwhelming very quickly. One story in scripture that has meant the most to me in times of major events is found in 1 Kings 18. Elijah, a prophet of God, is brought to his knees in self pity and feelings of being overwhelmed. At one point he asks for God to take his life.  By nature we humans can become overwhelmed in a situation and begin to withdraw.

                Since I am the worst when it comes to having a regular time of Bible study I . I am always looking for new ways to keep me focused. That is why one of the first apps I looked for was a bible for my iPad. I found three Bible apps that have been very effective in helping me maintain an effective devotional life due to their features and options.

                Debbie and I actually got to go out on a date and we didn’t waste the evening. We went to see Narnia: the Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The story line involves the two younger siblings and their annoying cousin. It begins and ends on the seas of Narnia. Lucy and Edmund find themselves in the water being picked up by King Caspian and the crew of the Dawn Treader who are actively seeking to find out what happened to 7 lords of Narnia.

I guess I really don’t need to explain much because almost every parent in the world tells their kids something that isn’t true in order to see the child’s reaction. Right?

In chapter two Joshua sends out two men to spy out the city that God’s people must conquer before moving into the land that was promised to them.

                I’ve been able to spend a lot of time around my boys over the past few weeks. One of the things that impresses me the most is the desire to do great BIG things that are absolutely impossible for them to do at their young ages. My youngest is 14 months old and he is already refusing to remain the “baby”. When he sees a crowd of crazed boys outside after church he wants down so that he can join in.

I’m used to going online and logging into my WordPress admin panel but that was becoming a time consuming venture since my internet speed had decreased recently. If I’m watching a Netflix video, searching the web on my iPad and running my laptop then the internet speed seems to drop off of the face of the earth.

I thought @timschraeder did a great job of explaining some beginner points of interest for those wanting to begin or even consider the option of using text messages in their church.

                I’ve had the opportunity to monitor the analytics for my church website for a little over two years now. Like most churches Burgess Road does not have a big budget for web development so I used Google Analytics as my main monitoring device. There are many advantages of using Google analytics but ultimately it is a program that is designed to give feedback to the business world and not the unique online property of a church or a non profit.

                I remember reading a book by R.A. Torrey called Talks To Men back when I had just graduated from college. In it I found the quote “A river can rise no higher than it’s source”. I know it is a natural law but it has so many spiritual applications. One such application is found here in this chapter as it relates to creativity and imagination.  The whole chapter is worthy of repeating but I wanted to highlight a small paragraph that I believe characterized the chapter well.

I came to the realization that the only way to know that i was doing a good job is by people not noticing the actual in work that I did but experiencing the effects of a job well done. I am not against any leadership making a big deal of someone putting forth good hard effort on a project but if that is all we are working for then I think we miss the purpose of doing the job.

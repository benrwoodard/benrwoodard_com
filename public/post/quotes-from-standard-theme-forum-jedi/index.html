<p>I recently had a chance to speak, via email, to <a href="http://twitter.com/manovotny">Michael Novotny</a> about his role in the forums of <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=108079&amp;cl=64302">Standard Theme</a>.  I&rsquo;ve taken several of his comments and will use them to give you a simple guide to get the most out of your forum experience.</p>
<p>[Side note: If you are not apart of a forum then you&rsquo;re missing out.  It is one ginormous question and answer session.  Being apart of an active online forum can be intimidating but it can also allow you and opportunity to stretch yourself in the area you are interested in.]</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Michael said that this was the purpose of the forum he moderated and I would have to say that every forum moderator and visitor shoould have this as their mission or purpose statement.  If you&rsquo;re participating to only get, we know that can end bad.  It&rsquo;s selfish.</p>
<p>Just as horrible is the other end of the spectrum, Giving.  Simply giving information leaves little room for learning.  Even if you think you know the answer based on a single comment or word choice it might be good to make sure by asking good questions.</p>
<p>That leads us to our next quote from the Forum Jedi:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I thought this was a great way of putting it.  If anyone is going to be a great citizen of a forum they must first realize they are always able to learn something from someone, even the most inexperienced.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is great!  I had never thought of using the word &ldquo;compassion&rdquo; to describe an appropriate attitude for a forum but it really fits.  The simple idea of dealing with everyone like they have value should not be uncommon in forums.  Unfortunately, in the anominoty of the web people often find themselves saying things and responding in waays they normally wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>At the end of his explanation of why and how he does what he does in the forums he said this&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Kinda funny how someone can relate a simple forum to the monumental act of &ldquo;changing the world&rdquo; but this is PASSION at it&rsquo;s purest form.  I love his enthusiasm about interacting and helping people online.  I don&rsquo;t doubt this carries  over into his daily physical life.</p>
<p>It was great getting this detailed answer from one of the best in the biz.  I trust his answers helped you as much as it did me.</p>
<p>What other tips could you give to someone just starting out in a forum?</p>

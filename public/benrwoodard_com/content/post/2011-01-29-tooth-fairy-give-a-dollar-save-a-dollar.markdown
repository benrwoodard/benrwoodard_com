				The featured image is my wife @supernightnurse tying a string around Ryan's (6) loose tooth.  He has an adult tooth growing right behind it and have been told, by a reliable source, that it will not come in right if this baby tooth doesn't fall out soon.  If it doesn't come in right the we will have to take him to the Dentist.  Do you know how much dental work is?

So we did what anyone would do trying to save a buck, we sold him on getting a prize from the tooth fairy.

It is loose but apparently not _that_ loose yet.  Ryan yanked on that strong for about an hour with no results.  We even snuck in a few surprise yanks just to make sure he was doing a good job but got no results.

He lost his first tooth last November and is excited about the Tooth Fairy stopping by again.  I'm hoping it is soon because I can't stand watching him play with his tooth.

Ryan took his story to school of how much the Tooth Fairy left for him and came back that afternoon with stories of the Tooth Fairy leaving bikes, Nintendo DS's, $100.00, and trips to Disney.

Trust me when I say that I'm not trying to keep up with the Jonse's but I think I'm actually ahead of the game on this one.  I was doing a little research on the Tooth Fairy and look what I found.

According to Wikipedia:


<blockquote>In early Europe, it was a tradition to bury baby teeth that fell out. The tradition is still very much alive and well in Ireland and Great Britain, where it is common for young children to believe in the Tooth Fairy. When a child's **sixth tooth**(emphasis mine) falls out, it is customary for the tooth fairy to slip a gift or money under the child's pillow, but to leave the tooth as a reward for the child growing strong.</blockquote>


See there?  We give a gift for every tooth not just the 6th one.  That means our Tooth Fairy is giving 6x's the amount to Ryan than other kids around the world.

Good job Tooth Fairy!  Keep up the good work. :)

Honestly, if you make a big deal about this with your children and leave them huge things for their teeth, Awesome.  I am not against big surprises.  I love it when parents are able to do great things for their kids.  But I am curious about how much people do give their kids for losing a tooth on average.

Now it's your turn.  What have been some prizes you have left or been left for a tooth?

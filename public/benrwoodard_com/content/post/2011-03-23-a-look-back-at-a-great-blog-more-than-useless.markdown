				When I first began blogging I had a few blogs that inspired me every day and taught me how to create a community around my blog. "More Than Useless" was one of the first blogs I [![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/tomsface.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/tomsface.jpg)remember getting involved with.  A few of my readers will remember this blog by Tom McFarlin ([@moretom](http://twitter.com/moretom)).  

Tom produced some incredible articles that drew some great people into inspiring conversations. He now writes for [ChurchCode](http://churchco.de) and does a great job!  Even still, I can't say that I have completely forgiven Tom for abandoning us.  But, I can't blame him either.  He has moved on to produce some incredible things in the last year.

It is hard to believe that **April 2nd** will be the one year anniversary of it's untimely death. Looking back reminds me of some great friendships that begin in the old commenting threads.  It might sound like I'm being a little over dramatic to some but those of you who spent time on the blog, I'm sure you understand.  

I wanted to post the last article because it seriously encompasses how inspiring this blog really was to some of us.  When I think of goals for my blog, I reference what I learned from Tom on "More Than Useless".  Here is the last post that I have saved in my Google Reader for almost a year now.<!-- more -->



<blockquote>A More Than Useless Eulogy
by [brettbarner](http://www.bybrettbarner.com/)
This is a guest post by Brett Barner.
Yesterday, Tom announced the untimely end of More Than Useless. In order to honor Useless in a tomfoolery sort of way, I asked if I could write a eulogy in remembrance of our recently passed friend. Tom cordially agreed. He also wanted me to thank all those who sent flowers, cards, and for your thoughts and prayers.
A more than useless eulogy:
Henry James once said, “Sorrow comes in great waves…but it rolls over us, and though it may almost smother us it leaves us on the spot and we know that if it is strong we are stronger inasmuch as it passes and we remain.”
Useless was a dear blog to me. I will never forget how much fun we had together. I would visit useless almost every business day. We would talk about Mondays, marriage, and debate such things like blog commenting systems and biblical inerrancy.
Useless never liked to be the center of attention. If he was here with us today, he would want us to take the focus off of him and put it on us. He’d ask us what we were going to be doing this weekend, or what our blog address was, or what we were reading.
I will miss talking movies with him. He loved to discuss Lord of the Rings, Back to the Future, and Star Wars. I will miss our arguments as well as our agreements.
What will I remember most about Useless? The way he could make me laugh. Useless loved to joke around. I remember some of the things that he would share with us. Like showing us how Tom enters rooms, or how Kyle Reed’s hair stays awesome. He was always saying things like “tubular” and sharing the wisdom of Harry Potter.
As a Christian blog, and through his testimony and the notes on walking with God that he shared, we can take comfort knowing that Useless is in blog Heaven right now. Where all comments are constructive, and blog traffic has no end.
Useless’ death was sudden, but his memory is not forgotten. His legacy lives on through his children, @tomsfoolery (now @moretom) and Facebook Tom. If he were here right now, he’d have a funny story to share that would help us forget our sadness in this moment.
I would like to close with a poem that I wrote,



> 
> <blockquote>You helped me get through my Monday’s,
And “awesome” is what I knew you were.
Let me remember your organized ways,
And showing me how life could be so tubular.
I’m glad you allowed me to be apart of it all,
The end happened like you said it did.
Your memory is etched on my heart walls,
Like our comments that couldn’t be edited.
So as this chapter begins to close,
And I look back at your memory,
You were simply just a blog to most,
But you were more than useless to me..</blockquote>
>

We’ll miss you, Useless.</blockquote>




*sniff *sniff  Good times!

What blogs of the past influenced you to do better things in life?

([Featured Image: I know it is a little tacky but some memories you hold on to and others you have to get rid of. Right?](http://philip.greenspun.com/images/pcd0281/sell-your-bad-memories-10.3.jpg?))

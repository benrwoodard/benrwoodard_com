				I received some incredible news almost 3 weeks ago but I was hesitant to say anything.  I could hardly believe it was true.  I even reached out to one of the organizers of the event and jokingly asked if there was an error in the emails that were sent out.  There wasn't any errors and now I'm listed as a speaker for this years WordCamp in ATL!  Woot!

I've been going to WordCamp Atlanta every time they have held it since 2010.  If you don't know what that it is, it's an amazing conference for anyone using WordPress.  Everyone from developers, designers, users to beginners find incredible value from this conference.  The sessions are incredible but the true gold is in the networking that takes place.  As you can see from my sidebar image, meeting [Matt ](http://ma.tt/)and getting my picture taken with the rock star was a huge thrill.  Hanging out with the [8BIT](http://8bit.io) team and being mistaken for "one of the guys" was beyond awesome.

This year I set a small goal for myself.  I wanted to submit an application to present a talk at this year's WordCamp.  I've spoken in front of people for over ten years now but this is different. I didn't go to college or seminary to talk about WordPress or SEO.  So to get myself warmed up to the idea I submitted a speaker application with a topic that has had my attention for over a year and waited to see what would happen.  It was a small step outside my comfort zone but it was a measurable and achievable so I sat down one night on my couch and knocked it out.

I never had any expectations but I loved the topic and was looking forward to the *small chance that I would be chosen to speak.

Forward ahead about two weeks and look what I found:

I had a hard time believing it.  It was something I always wanted to do but "it was just a goal".  Well now it was an accomplishment based on the fact that I set a smaller goal that was achievable.

I think I might be on to something here. :)

![WCBadge2013-Speaker](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/WCBadge2013-Speaker.jpg)Needless to say, I'm extremely excited about speaking on a combination of two of my passions - Local SEO - WordPress.  I'm busy planning, researching and gathering my talk so that I can bring as much value as possible. My only goal now is to give back a small part of the value that the community has given to me.

No matter your level of experience with WordPress, I'd urge you to go to WordCamp Atlanta 2013.  The people you meet there will literally change your life.  Go check out the[ speakers list](http://2013.atlanta.wordcamp.org/speaker-lineup/) and [grab your tickets today](http://2013.atlanta.wordcamp.org/register/).

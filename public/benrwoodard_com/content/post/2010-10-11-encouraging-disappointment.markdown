The other weekend I made it up to Atlanta with the hopes of not only spending time with family but finally getting together with a couple of the people on twitter that have made a huge impact on my professional and personal life. It was amazing that they were even contemplating about meeting with me early Sunday morning but even more impressive was the reason that we couldn’t end up meeting up. I know for me, one of the biggest struggles in life is balancing my personal desire to achieve more in my professional life and taking care of my family. It just never seems to get easier

so anytime I can see an example of a guy taking care of his wife and family over something else is a great encouragement for me.

All three just couldn’t work it out this time so I was incredibly disappointed. While thinking it over I noticed a trend though that had a big impact on me. Everyone one of these guys couldn’t make it out for some free coffee because they needed to take care of their wives! That is awesome! Anytime one of my friends cancels on me for their wife they should be praised. I hope I can be the husband I need to be to my beautiful wife (@supernightnurse) and then encourage those around me to do the same. Thanks guys for being such a great example for me and many other husbands that you influence on a daily basis.

				[![Rock of ages](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0389.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0389.jpg)Could my efforts save me from the punishment I deserve in my rejection of God? My sin cannot be overcome by my hands or wisdom.

This **_experiment_** of trying to save myself has been repeated and failed in every soul that has walked the earth from the beginning of time. It is impossible to please God through my hands or intentions. 

Accepting the atonement of Christ's sacrifice is the only way to escape the wrath of a Holy God. 

**It's His mercy that allows us to see the way. ****It is His Grace that allows us to be accepted.**

Poem: "Rock of Ages" by Augustus Toplady - 1776

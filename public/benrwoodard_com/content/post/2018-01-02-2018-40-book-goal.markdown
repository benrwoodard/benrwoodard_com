				I have set a crazy goal of reading and documenting my journey through 40 books in 2018. Take the journey with me.



 	
  1. The Exceptional Presenter - Timothy Keogel (kay-gul) - read 1/2/18

 	
  2. Robert Klein - Seeing What Others Don't -read 1/16/18

 	
  3. The Oz Principle - read 1/6/18

 	
  4. A Sense Of Urgency - read 1/10/18

 	
  5. Never Split the Difference - Chris Voss - listened 1/4/18

 	
  6. The Speed of Trust - Stephen M R Covey - read 2/11/18


Great thing about this?  I read more than 40 but stopped keeping track because it was causing me to limit the energy I was putting into it.  Why is that?

				[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0376.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0376.jpg)The law is able to curse and punish. It doesn't know mercy or grace. It only knows justice and condemnation. 

Through the Law we are able to see God's Holiness and Glory but we also see our state of sinfulness that "falls short" of the mark. But, what the law could not do, Jesus did.

In Jesus the righteousness of the law was fulfilled. Gal. 3:13 - "_Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us..._" 

Jesus took our curse for us. The cost was high but He took our debt and paid it all. No part could I play because I was powerless.

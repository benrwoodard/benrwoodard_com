				Did you know that Single Focus Project Management or SFPM was taught by Christ. (I'm not saying He is necessarily endorsing my blog article but...)

Remember when He said that the whole Law hinged on one law?

_Matthew 22:37 "Love The Lord your God with all your heart and will all you soul and with all your mind."_

I have to say that is a great example of what I'm trying to implement in my life, but on a very practical level.  It is the  idea of focusing on one thing that allows you to accomplish something bigger.

So here are four easy steps you can take in order to start applying this method of management in your life?

Four easy steps to setting up your own Single Focus Project Management:




1.** Select the project.**
Mine for example was keeping the kitchen clean.  The ultimate goal was to allow my family to have a more relaxed evening and morning.




2.** List the tasks**
These are the tasks that have to be accomplished before the goal or project (i.e. clean kitchen) can be reached.  I knew I had to keep up with dishes, floors, counter tops, meals, a stove, a refrigerator, a microwave, windows, and a highchair.  All of these tasks were needing to be accomplished on a pretty regular basis.




3. **Find a commonality**




The common link between each of these tasks ended up being the kitchen sink.  All tasks hinged on having a clean sink.  I need an empty sink to wash the floors.  I needed an empty sink to put away the dishes. It was as if each detail had an arrow pointing to the sink as the way of accomplishing that.




The living room would be different.  Bathrooms may be the toilet or the tub or even just putting away the towels.  But again, take all your tasks in that specific room or rooms and find a common relationship between them all.  Go as big as you like.  Bedroom and Living-rooms seem to have the floor as their common denominator.




4. **Set a goal**




Don't stop until you accomplish that one single task.  As a result you should find accomplishing all the others will be automatic.  In my example goal of keeping the kitchen clean I had to forget about cleaning everything else and just concentrate on keeping the kitchen sink clean.


When you figure at least half your time is spent trying to find what to do next this could save you a ton of time.  In fact, it is much harder for me to concentrate on 5 or 6 different tasks to accomplish than it is to focus on one.  Give it a shot.

I'm still in the process of testing this out but it is going pretty well.  I'm always looking for more situations that the Single Focus Project Management (SFPM) system will work in.

I'd love to find out other situations you could apply this principle to.  Just leave a comment and let me know. Who knows you might be the first guest author on this blog.  :) (wow, what an honor)

				When the iPhones first came out I have to admit I wasn't very interested in it. I was curious about it and thought it was pretty cool but really had no use for it.

At that time I was getting emails from family and friends but never really interacted that much on the interwebs. 

About 5 years ago my awesome wife bought me the new Samsung Blackjack but I ended up taking it back for a nice flip phone and save the money. 

A lot has changed since those days. Now about everything I do is online. It is where I find myself earning a [small income](http://wingspanmarketing.com), [learning everyday](http://seoporch.com), and [shareing my life](http://benrwoodard.com). 

So for about three years now I have seen how the iPhone could be a huge help to my productivity but it was still not a necessity. Diapers were always more important when upgrading came around. Until now.

When ATT announced the $49 price for the iPhone 3GS I began making plans to get one when we could upgrade in March. That day finally arrived. :)

So I now have my iPhone who has been named Lil' Doug. (Doug is my iPad) I could not be happier about how this will  increase my productivity while at home raising my three boys.

Alright, now I could use your help! What essential productivity apps, besides Wordpress, would you suggest for a new iPhone user? I have Doug so I am familiar with most of the iPad apps but many of the iPhone apps are really different.

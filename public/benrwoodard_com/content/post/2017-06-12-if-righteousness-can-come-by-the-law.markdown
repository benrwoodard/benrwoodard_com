				[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0372.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0372.jpg)Paul was amazed at the possibility of those who saw the need for Christ for salvation but then sought to "perfect" their salvation by works. (Gal. 3:3) 

It is Jesus who is the perfection of our faith. He is the Righteousness we need and must continually rely on.

It's not the works that we have done but the Righteousness that He Is.

What am I relying on for my relationship with God that isn't Jesus?

Bonus: The question I should ask myself after hearing the Abraham and Isaac story is not whether or not I would sacrifice my son but whether or not I am in need of the sacrifice of God's Son because of my sin.

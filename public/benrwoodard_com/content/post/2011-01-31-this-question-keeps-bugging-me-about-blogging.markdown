				I have been encouraged over the past few months by witnessing several of my friends online create some incredibly valuable content.  I consider it a privilege to read their posts and interact with them online.

The question that has been bugging me lately is: "Am I adding value to those I'm in contact with online?"

The internet is based on a free and open system of sharing interesting information.  The idea of success online is found in one word (insert trumpet) ***Value***.

Here is a short list that explains what I **understand** as the way to create value.  They are also the motivation that keeps me going when there is little proof that I'm succeeding in my goals.

1. I understand I'm new at this and have a long way to go till I can see better than average results.

2. I understand I've got a chance to encourage and build up others not defeat or discourage them.  I never want to be above average just because "average" gets knocked down.

3. I understand I'm more passionate about my interest than someone just trying to make a buck. Therefore, I will work harder and longer to achieve what others feel is impossible.

I know that much of success is simply doing the necessary tasks over and over again.  These three items keep me focused on accomplishing those tasks to the best of my ability.

What else should someone "understand" in order to succeed at something in life?  Thoughts?

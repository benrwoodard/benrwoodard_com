				I'm in the process of looking for a position doing internet marketing or web development.  It becomes very frustrating sometimes when I have no control over any company's vetting process.  

I know that many times it has absolutely nothing to do with who I am or what I've submitted that the company doesn't choose me, but that doesn't stop me from blaming myself sometimes.  

If a company decides to go another way it must have been something I did. Right?

**WRONG!**

Oswald Chambers quotes from Galatians 1:15 "But when it pleased God..." and then encourages us to "leave room for God".  

If we don't leave room for Him in these decisions we will easily slip into a phase of bitterness or discouragement. And when all is said and done we can even begin to question the **"Goodness" of God**.  

I have to say, through this whole job hunting process I have been in every one of those phases at least once.

Chambers comments made me think of times when I guide my children indirectly without them noticing.  When my sons have some money we will take them to a Dollar General or something and let them "pick" out a toy.  

The boys will walk up and down the aisle checking things out with excitement and anticipation.  

If you have ever been standing beside a young boy in a toy aisle you know what I'm talking about. The **anticipation** of purchasing a toy almost brings them into convulsions.  They pick up the toy and **imagine** the multitude of ways they will play with it.  

What they don't realize, is that I'm looking at the toys with them and determining which ones I know they will actually play with (I know my boys) and which ones they could easily break.  

I gently turn their attention onto the toys that I deem appropriate, safe, and durable.  Most of the time they have no clue that they are walking out of the store with a toy that I chose for them.  This is good parenting.

Unfortunately, a few time there has arisen a conflict.  Usually this is with my 6 year old (Ryan).  He is becoming wise to my _"guidance"_ and begins to protest my _"persuasive"_ ways.  

This commences a struggle of the wills that will usually end with him either grumpily getting the toy I pick out or nothing at all.

If I do it right, he doesn't know any different and purchases the "best" toy out of an aisle of junk.  

If I do it wrong, and expose my plans of manipulation, he is angry with me and feels I'm not letting him get the toy because I don't understand or that I'm just being unfair.  (note: God doesn't manipulate because he is sovereign, unfortunately I am not.  God simply _guides and directs_.

These feelings come because Ryan thinks he **knows best**.

This is the same way I see my response to my Savior.  While looking for a job or a way to further my education I can see how awesome it would be to "live here" or "do that".  Sometimes I can take offense to God closing the door.  

I can become discouraged by feeling that I'm not good enough or that I didn't do something the "right" way.  

Much like my boys in an aisle of toys ready to purchase, I'm excited about what God has in-store for my family and me.  I know our next move is going to be exciting.  

Today, I'm asking God for the job I want but will also ask that God  please give me the ability to "leave room for You".

Do you have any encouraging stories of God guiding a certain way when you thought another way would be better?  How did it turn out?  How did you know? 

I would love to hear about it.

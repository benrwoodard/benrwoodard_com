Seeing the proportion of the whole is a valuable visualization when looking at different segments.  Recently I was asked to explore the differences between two audiences and using the proportion charts were incredibly telling.  The ability to quickly identify if there could be differences between two groups and then identify what the difference is, can help anyone in their data exploration process in addition to telling the story.

```{r, setup, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message= FALSE, include = FALSE}
head(UCBAdmissions)
```

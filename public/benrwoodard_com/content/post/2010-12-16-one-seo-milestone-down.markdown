				Early this morning I passed my last test to be [certified as a Professional Internet Marketer](http://www.seo-training-course.com/certificate.php?id=46993918.) from [Web CEO](http://webceo.com).  There isn't a "web standard" out there that determines what it takes to be called a Professional Internet Marketer so any "certification" has to be looked into and taken with a grain of salt.  This course gives a large introduction into the many different aspects of web marketing such as:

<!-- more -->search engine optimization, website optimization, search engine marketing, social media marketing, email marketing, pay per click marketing, web analytics, etc....  Web CEO university compiled 104 lessons with 19 quizzes and tests.  The quizzes and tests were very helpful in nailing down specific principles and rules that are important to understand. In addition to these lessons, each section had a "reading list" of articles that looked deeper into that specific topic.

It took me about a month of reading and studying in order to accomplish this goal.  Of course I wasn't in a classroom setting and I never had more than 2 or 3 hours at a time to work on it.  The content covers a lot of ground but I personally have a hard time calling anyone or myself an **expert **in any specific aspect of internet marketing after taking this course. I would however say that anyone who finishes this certification would be competent enough to handle a paid position in a company that was looking to advance their online presence.  If your considering a deeper knowledge in the field of Internet Marketing, **I would recommend [this course](http://www.seo-training-course.com/whatsinside.php#)**.

What's  Next?  Thanks for asking.  I'm going to be going through the online course that Google has set up: [Google Analytics Qualification](http://www.google.com/support/conversionuniversity/bin/request.py?hl=en&contact_type=indexSplash&rd=1).  I cannot wait to get started because I have a ton of questions about Google Analytics.

What other certifications are out there?  Is there a specific course or test that you see as highly regarded among the SEO community?

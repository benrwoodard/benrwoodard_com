Ever been in one appointment rooms with 4 boys and 2 adults all at once? I hadn't either until today. The Dr was great and the 1.5 hours passed really fast.
Thankfully it was just for well child checks but with 4 crazy boys in my house I am expecting to see a lot of our pediatrician in the coming years.
Hopefully they won't always end in shots and a sad 3 year old.

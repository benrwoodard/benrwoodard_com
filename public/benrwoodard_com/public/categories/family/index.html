                I was looking over the biblical example of project management according to Nehemiah. If you haven&#39;t heard of this story in the Old Testament of the Bible then you are truly missing out. It is a story that begs the question &#34;What can I do? I&#39;m only a(n) __________.&#34; You fill in the blank. This guy was a trusted servant of the king but he was in charge of one thing, the drinks of the king.

I hadn’t either until today. The Dr was great and the 1.5 hours passed really fast. Thankfully it was just for well child checks but with 4 crazy boys in my house I am expecting to see a lot of our pediatrician in the coming years. Hopefully they won’t always end in shots and a sad 3 year old.

Every once in a while though, God gives us a gift of hope and future. We see the world in a different lens when we concentrate on these gifts. It becomes a world of possibilities, bright future, and love.

Here is the part that got me. The games that we play with our kids are fun but the really good games all tend to have one thing in common.

                I was outside with son#2 when I set up challenge for myself. I told Matthew I was going to pitch a golf ball into the cup holder of a lawn chair from about 10 feet.
Impossible? Nope, the hole is bigger than the golf ball and I have had similar luck from 137 yards. I knew all it would take is some trial and error and plenty of chances. I began to think of the similarities between setting little challenges and setting life goals.

How about this: “What’s the worst that can happen?” There’s a phrase that has gotten many a kid in trouble at school.
Both of these phrases and so many more like them are used everyday by people trying to persuade someone else to do something that they themselves won’t.

                Last night was Monster Jam in Pensacola, Florida. It turned out to be one of the best events I&#39;ve ever taken my sons to. Every year I want to take my sons to Monster Jam but there are several things that held me back. Each one of those reservations ended up being false assumptions.  So what were my reservations? Thanks for asking! I’d love to share because I want everyone to experience what my two oldest boys and I experienced at the Monster Jam Pensacola event.

I figured it would allow me an opportunity to gain some ground on my article writing.  Instead of me gaining ground I have slipped back to square one, almost. What’s up with that? It feels like life has done a roundhouse kick to my forehead.

                Did you know that Single Focus Project Management or SFPM was taught by Christ. (I&#39;m not saying He is necessarily endorsing my blog article but...)  Remember when He said that the whole Law hinged on one law?
Matthew 22:37 “Love The Lord your God with all your heart and will all you soul and with all your mind.&#34;

If it doesn&#39;t come in right the we will have to take him to the Dentist. Do you know how much dental work is?

                I&#39;m in the process of looking for a position doing internet marketing or web development. It becomes very frustrating sometimes when I have no control over any company&#39;s vetting process.  I know that many times it has absolutely nothing to do with who I am or what I’ve submitted that the company doesn’t choose me, but that doesn’t stop me from blaming myself sometimes.
If a company decides to go another way it must have been something I did.

I’m going on two weeks of keeping my kitchen sink spotless. Not just well managed but completely free of dishes and junk that seems to accumulate very quickly on an hourly basis in our house.

                Sometimes the hardest part of accomplishing a goal is simply not quitting. Life gets overwhelming very quickly. One story in scripture that has meant the most to me in times of major events is found in 1 Kings 18. Elijah, a prophet of God, is brought to his knees in self pity and feelings of being overwhelmed. At one point he asks for God to take his life.  By nature we humans can become overwhelmed in a situation and begin to withdraw.

                ...minus the party.  We were privileged to have both our sets of parents down this past holiday season. One came in during Thanksgiving and and one during Christmas. It was great to share our boys with them but I know they felt like they were in the middle of a hurricane when all three were at the top of their game.
It was also the first time that I was home and totally focused (I had no where to go) on the boys for two weeks without school to break things up.

                There are certain times in life where something so simple is just overlooked by the wisest and smartest of us all. Following an extremely simple command can make a world of difference in life. Here is a short list of phrases I have learned can make or break a situation.    Keep your head down (golf)
  Keep your eye on the ball (baseball)
  Two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time (driving)

                When I think of all my great memories of Christmas in the past I see that my value system is greatly influenced by what happened during these short two weeks. It is kind of scary to think that my valuable memories usually begin about 5 years old. My 6-year-old is entering a stage in life that will establish what he deems as worthy of his time and effort, not just during the Christmas but for the entire year.

Lucy and Edmund find themselves in the water being picked up by King Caspian and the crew of the Dawn Treader who are actively seeking to find out what happened to 7 lords of Narnia.

I guess I really don’t need to explain much because almost every parent in the world tells their kids something that isn’t true in order to see the child’s reaction. Right?

                I’ve been able to spend a lot of time around my boys over the past few weeks. One of the things that impresses me the most is the desire to do great BIG things that are absolutely impossible for them to do at their young ages. My youngest is 14 months old and he is already refusing to remain the “baby”. When he sees a crowd of crazed boys outside after church he wants down so that he can join in.

It was amazing that they were even contemplating about meeting with me early Sunday morning but even more impressive was the reason that we couldn’t end up meeting up.

                I was washing windows the other morning and thought of how I would know if I was actually doing a good job at it and feel rewarded in my efforts. I came to the realization that the only way to know that i was doing a good job is by people not noticing the actual in work that I did but experiencing the effects of a job well done. I am not against any leadership making a big deal of someone putting forth good hard effort on a project but if that is all we are working for then I think we miss the purpose of doing the job.

Here is one of my favorites as a kid and I was able to introduce it today to my kids via Netflix. High five for the interwebs!
   Do you think it is necessary for dads to try and bridge some of the generational gap with their kids?

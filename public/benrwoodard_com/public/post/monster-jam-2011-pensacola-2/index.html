</code></pre>
<p>So what were my reservations?  Thanks for asking! I&rsquo;d love to share because I want everyone to experience what my two oldest boys and I experienced at the Monster Jam Pensacola event.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Space</strong>
Well, for starters, the Pensacola civic center isn&rsquo;t exactly the Georgia Dome.  It&rsquo;s large enough for hockey crowds and rink but not much more.  Other places in the world may need a lot of seating and arena space for hockey but as you can imagine, Pensacola doesn&rsquo;t need that many seats or square feet for a hockey game. (sad but true)</p>
<p><strong>Gas</strong>
The next concern I had was with the fumes.  I figured we would be gagging every time one of those huge engines started.  The ventilation system is probably good but how can anything indoors and as small as the Pensacola Civic Center be any good at cleaning the air?</p>
<p><strong>Noise</strong>
My final misconception was with the response of my boys.  I knew they would enjoy seeing the big trucks but the noise level must be outrageous.  There is no way my two boys would sit through a whole event with hundreds of decibels slapping their ears every time the trucks took off.</p>
<p>As I said before, each one of these assumptions proved to be false.  My two sons walked out the Pensacola Civic Center after 3 hours of Monster Jam as happy as ever I have seen them.</p>
<p>The <strong>space</strong> became a mute point because the purpose of going to see big trucks is not racing but power.  We wanted to see, hear, and feel the power of those monster trucks.  This was not left out of the program.  In fact, it was enhanced by the small arena floor.  Even though the &ldquo;race&rdquo; was literally 5 cars side by side you could still feel the incredible power when they gunned those trucks.  It would rattle the very core of your body. AWESOME!</p>
<p>The <strong>gas</strong> became a non-issue as well.  As soon as they started their engines I noticed a soft almost sweet smell in the air.  I&rsquo;m not sure what exactly what those trucks ran on but it wasn&rsquo;t regular gas.  Sure it got thick sometimes but the fumes from those vehicles were no problem at all.</p>
<p>Finally, the <strong>noise</strong> was suppose to be so LOUD that you couldn&rsquo;t even hear yourself think.  This part was true but it didn&rsquo;t prevent my boys from having a good time at all.  They both coped with it in their own little way.  Ryan screamed and jumped around each time to see if he could hear himself over the roaring engines.  Matthew covered his ears with his hands the whole show (even when there were no cars going).</p>
<p>For me, the noise level in the civic center was part of the excitement.  You could feel the power of those engines and witness their strength first hand.</p>
<p>Here are a few pictures from the event.</p>
<p>At first I was afraid Matthew wasn&rsquo;t going to make it through the event.  Here is how he looked as he asked me repeatedly  &ldquo;Is it over now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_851&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;614&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Matthew asked &ldquo;Is it over now?&rdquo; after 10 minutes.&quot;]<a href="http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/110311_200724.jpg"><img src="http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/110311_200724-1024x768.jpg" alt="Matthew covering his ears at Monster Jam Pensacola"></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Matthew was picked out by George Balhan (driver of the Mohawk Warrior) and handed a signed monster truck toy. He literally climbed the railing from the arena floor and made a bee line to Matthew. Ryan was on the steps screaming and dancing around so I though for sure he was going to get it but then George pointed to Matthew (ears covered and in my arms). It was one of the best events ever in this little man&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>Ryan was so excited to see a real live taco and sauce!  He has what the doctors call &ldquo;Permasmile Syndrome&rdquo; but should be ok after some down time.</p>
<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_861&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;614&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Ryan loved meeting Mr. Taco and Mr. Sauce&rdquo;]<a href="http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_0022.jpg"><img src="http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_0022-1024x768.jpg" alt="Ryan loved meeting Mr. Taco and Mr. Sauce"></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Here are a few more images of the trucks.</p>

<p>As you can see from the image above, the action was intense for everyone&hellip;but Gavin.  What can I say? It was already an hour past bed time.  :)</p>
<p>Most if not all of the images were captured by my good friend Wes Gozon.  Thanks Wes for such pictures.</p>
<p>Here is a short video of Mohawk Warrior in action.   Thanks George for making the even so special for me and my boys!</p>

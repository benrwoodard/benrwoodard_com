                            <p>I’ve been able to spend a lot of time around my boys over the past few weeks. One of the things that impresses me the most is the desire to do great <strong>BIG</strong> things that are absolutely impossible for them to do at their young ages. My youngest is 14 months old and he is already refusing to remain the “baby”. When he sees a crowd of crazed boys outside after church he wants down so that he can join in. I get irritated at Matthew (the middle son who will turn 4 in February) when I ask to help him do something and he responds with “I can do it <strong>MYSELF</strong>!”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>True, he shouldn’t yell at Daddy but he so badly wants to accomplish what <strong>HE</strong> has set out to do. There have been times when I will take a step back and watch in amusement at his refusal to accept assistance and struggle for minutes on end with one simple task that I offered help for. Usually, he will come to me a little later and ask for help but you can see he is intent on watching and learning what he needs to do next time to accomplish this “impossible” task.</p>
<p>Have you ever been a witness to someone who never says to themselves “I can do it myself” ? They become stagnant and lazy. There is always someone who can accomplish the task better and quicker so they find that person and hand the responsibility over to them. They never dream about what <em>could be,</em> because they have never done <em>what might</em> be. Their faith in God is only as big as what they “know” is possible. Mark Batterson in his book Primal says that at first the person will “love having a god that can be measured and managed in his mind. But there will come a point when sensory things and rational things won’t satisfy your holy curiosity.” (<a href="http://www.theprimalmovement.com/">Primal</a>, p.105)</p>
<p>I’m currently working on several projects that my son’s attitude about life is inspiring. They are beyond me, too big for my britches, “impossible” for me to do. But, I know I have been given the desire and passion for them from my God. I’m going to set my attitude on “I can do it” so that I am able to see how AWEsome my God is.</p>
<p>Do you think God gives us desires that are beyond our ability so that He will get the credit? How can you tell it is God telling you to do the impossible and not your own selfish pride?</p>

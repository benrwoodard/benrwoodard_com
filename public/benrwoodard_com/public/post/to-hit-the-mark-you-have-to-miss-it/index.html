I began to think of the similarities between setting little challenges and setting life goals. I don&rsquo;t know too many people who live life like they achieve success 100% of the time. On the other hand, I do know many of the same people (including myself) who expect it that much. Maybe you know exactly how I feel then. Like when I think I have failed because something didn&rsquo;t turn out like I thought it should.
<img src="http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/20110414-034237.jpg" alt="20110414-034237.jpg">At an M2LIVE conference about a year and a half ago John Saddington and Tony steward were answering some questions when they said: &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t smarter or more talented than you, we&rsquo;ve just made more mistakes&rdquo;.
This is so big for me. We learn in life either by experience or by lesson. Both of which require _failure _in order to learn.</p>
<p>The idea of learning from my mistakes isn&rsquo;t new to me, the thought of winning from my mistakes was.</p>
<p>There are two things that hit me while thinking about this. They are two essential ingredients that go into success: fun and failure.</p>
<p>From what I can see, in order to succeed at something we should enjoy doing &lsquo;it&rsquo; and we should work hard at learning from mistakes.</p>
<p>It may be simple but it takes a God given calling to to be passionate and determined in most jobs.</p>
<p>Just sayin.</p>

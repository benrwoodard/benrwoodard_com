</code></pre>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had an idea for the last 18 months or more.  Ever since losing my dream job at a church as the Youth/Associate/Web pastor I&rsquo;ve felt the desire to create a network for web ministry volunteers and professionals where ideas could be exchanged and ministry websites could be easily built, maintained and advanced.  I have to say, I&rsquo;ve tested, prodded, talked, and invested enough to get this thing done.  I&rsquo;ve literally spent weeks fine tuning my ideas to where I felt it was doable only to wake up the next morning to find so much more I needed to do before I could feel comfortable enough to move forward.</p>
<p>Today is different.  I&rsquo;m ready to move forward.</p>
<p><strong>Finger #1</strong></p>
<p>This <a href="http://tentblogger.com/benny-hsu/">article by Benny Hsu</a> was the first finger in my face this morning that reaffirmed my process was not a process of failings but of refining.  The last 18 months or so of this process has been incredibly draining and,in some ways overwhelming. It is so easy to equate my &lsquo;lack&rsquo; of finishing this project and getting it launched with failure after failure.  Like Benny said in his article on <a href="http://tentblogger.com">Tentblogger.com</a>, &ldquo;I didn’t fail. Instead I realized what I didn’t like to do. That was very important to me because I always had so many ideas, but didn’t know where to start.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Finger #2</strong>
This was the last and final finger I needed in my face today.  Chris Ames is incredible at what he does.  He was one that took some time with me to help me refine my GREAT idea. I know my idea was most likely not what he had in mind in the article titled <a href="http://8bit.io/im-not-impressed-with-your-great-idea">&ldquo;I’M NOT IMPRESSED WITH YOUR GREAT IDEA&rdquo;</a> but it felt as if I was sitting in my pew on Sunday morning and no one else was in the auditorium except the preacher and me.  You know that feeling?  Yep.</p>
<p>So here is my GREAT IDEA.  <a href="http://wpministry.com">WPMinistry.com</a> is my opportunity to share with the web ministry community my thoughts and feelings about the best opportunities to do web ministry using WordPress.  That is just a small fraction of my idea.</p>
<p>I developed <a href="http://wpministry.net">WPMinistry.net</a> to fill a need I&rsquo;ve seen among ministries.  You can read more about it on the site but basically it allows a small church to sign up for a free account, develop a website with TONS of features designed for churches and ministries, and then upgrade to a monthly subscription fee for help, a domain name, and updates.  No need to bother with hosting, domain registrars, looking for developers, or anything else that usually comes with developing a website.</p>
<p><a href="http://wpministry.net">Check it out</a>.  It&rsquo;s still being refined but it is my BIG idea and I&rsquo;m ready to let the word out.  :)</p>
<p>What do you think?  Should I still keep my mouth shut about this?</p>

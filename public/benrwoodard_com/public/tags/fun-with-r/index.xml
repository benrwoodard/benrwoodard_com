      <description>I want to make a deck of cards. Here is how I do it.
First we need to understand the elements of the deck of cards. There are 4 different suits, 13 different values, and 13 different faces.
Make the suits in order by naming the four suits and listing them 13 times so that all 3 lists are the same length.
 Make the faces by listing out all 13 and we can duplicate it from there.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s begun. I&#39;ve finally begun executing an idea I have had in my head for over a year. The idea came from the frustration of trying to develop a new website for [Burgess Road](http://burgessroad.org) last spring.  Several times I came across an issue with the new site that had me seeking advice. I can remember surfing through all the other church websites in town looking for a link to a local network of web ministry pros and volunteers but I never found one.</description>

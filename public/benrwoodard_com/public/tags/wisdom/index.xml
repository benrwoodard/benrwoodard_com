      <description>[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0488.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0488.jpg)In 1 Corinthians 1 Paul explains that there should be no divisions in the church. According to Paul, the &amp;quot;wisdom of man&amp;quot; believes the gospel message is foolishness and therefore anyone who follows after the cunning words of a man&#39;s message just because it &amp;quot;makes sense&amp;quot; more than another is in the wrong.  Paul goes on to explain in chapter 2 that true wisdom in the Gospel Mesage (cross and resurrection) can only be understood through the Spirit.</description>

      <description>![Weak things of this world are strong ](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0423.jpg)It is hard to comprehend but easy to experience in our culture. The idea that the worldly system is going to naturally believe the things of God are weak is something we need to consider when we begin evaluating the impact a Biblically based teaching will have in our life.  This is not asceticism. That is a form of legalism that taught people to make themselves weak and foolish in order to &amp;ldquo;suffer&amp;rdquo; with Christ.</description>

      <description>I was outside with son#2 when I set up challenge for myself. I told Matthew I was going to pitch a golf ball into the cup holder of a lawn chair from about 10 feet.
Impossible? Nope, the hole is bigger than the golf ball and I have had similar luck from 137 yards. I knew all it would take is some trial and error and plenty of chances. I began to think of the similarities between setting little challenges and setting life goals.</description>

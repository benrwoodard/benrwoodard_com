				It's begun.  I've finally begun executing an idea I have had in my head for over a year.  The idea came from the frustration of trying to develop a new website for [Burgess Road](http://burgessroad.org) last spring.  

Several times I came across an issue with the new site that had me seeking advice.  I can remember surfing through all the other church websites in town looking for a link to a local network of web ministry pros and volunteers but I never found one.  

It was through that, that I came up with an idea of developing a _local _network of web ministry pros and volunteers that would help resource regional churches to clearly express the message of the Gospel on the internet.

About two weeks ago I had the pleasure of sitting down with two creatives from[ Hillcrest Church](http://hillcrestchurch.com) here in Pensacola. [Van Klimetz](http://twitter.com/artcola) and [Patrick Sanders](http://twitter.com/patricksanders) had some great ideas and we began to develop a strategy to reach out to local churches in order to help them gain a better presence online.

The other day I was able to meet up with Hannah Williams who is the creative director for [First Baptist Church Pensacola](http://fbcp.org).  She has incredible graphic design talent and will be a huge asset to the team. 

We are still on the look out for local area creatives who would like to get involved, so if you're interested let me know.  It's just the ground floor which means there is plenty of opportunity (hard work) to jump in and play (get used) a big role in the development.

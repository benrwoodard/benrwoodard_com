				I know that one of the first frustrations I came across with Doug (my iPad) was the inability to mirror the screen to a monitor.  As with any relationship, working through the conflict resolution process only strengthened our bond to each other.

Little did I know that this was possible all along. :(

I always knew you could connect to a monitor or projector in some of the apps but they were few and far between.  I used Keynote for my lessons in youth group for a while.  This proved to be very helpful for my lessons but only seemed to enhance the frustration between Doug and I.  I just couldn't understand why he was holding out on me with the rest of his apps.  Friends aren't suppose to do that!

Well, here's the fix:<!-- more -->


And just for the record. Doug, sorry for the misunderstanding!  I'm glad we're friends. :) BFF!

Did you know about this?  When did you know?  How did you find out?

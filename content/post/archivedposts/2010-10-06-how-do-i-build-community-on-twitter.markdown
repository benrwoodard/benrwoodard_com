I’ve talked several people recently that have asked the same question: “How do you get followers on twitter?” I don’t have a huge following on Twitter but I’ve built a very specific community in it that has been a huge help to me over the last year. “So how did I build that community?” _thanks for asking. _

 

_Here are three simple things to keep in mind as you begin building your community online._

**_Communicate:_** What do you enjoying with your spare time? Tweet about it. Are you fishing? What kind of fish did you catch? How many children do you have? What are you curious about? All of these questions will help you engage those using twitter that are into the same things you are in to. The main group of guys that I follow and interact with are into church web ministries around the world. It is so great to have a resource of 150 people doing the same things you are and able to help you whenever you get stuck.

 

**_Search:_** Find a specific word that you are interested in and search for it on twitter. I’ve been able to attend a few conferences/events and each one probably has a hash tag (#). These are searchable and every time for me it has been rich with people to follow. Try searching on Google for topics or questions that you are interested in. When there is a blog post that answers your question or gives information about your topic then follow them on twitter. Usually when you follow them they will follow you back and you can begin the next part of building your community.

 

**_Interact: _**Here is the kicker for many people. Twitter is about “community”. A community of people is a group that interacts with one another. Find out who is being mentioned by your friend. If there is a conversation that is going on, join in. Be careful not to be to nosy but if they are having the conversation over twitter then usually it is great to add your 2 cents in on the matter. The final and most important key to interaction is being **real**. Don’t try to fool anyone. It will be revealed in your comments and questions. 

 

These three keys have really helped me maintain a quality on Twitter that has benefited me and continues to yield an incredible amount of information that pertains to me. Most importantly keep it fun. Twitter is awesome and we should remember to keep it simple. It’s amazing to be able to communicate with someone on the other side of the world via Twitter.

How bout it Tweeps? Got any other advice that I might have overlooked? If not I will consider myself a genius. :)

				Since I am the worst when it comes to having a regular time of Bible study I .  I am always looking for new ways to keep me focused.  That is why one of the first apps I looked for was a bible for my iPad.  I found three Bible apps that have been very effective in helping me maintain an effective devotional life due to their features and options.  Each one has been a big help to me in their own unique way.

Here is what I found to be some of the advantages of the big three Bible iPad apps I currently use.

Logos Software is an incredible asset to have if you are interested in studying the bible in depth.  This app would have been very helpful when I was back in college and seminary learning Hebrew and Greek.  I have used this as a great study tool when I'm digging in to a difficult or unfarmiliar passage.  This resource runs seriously deep with the amount of information it holds.

Olive Tree has been a major player in the bible software industry for a long time.  It seeks to intersect the fast paced world with the timeless scriptures and is doing a good job of it.  The iPad app is very smooth and syncs with [Evernote](http://evernote.com) by allowing you to take notes on specific verses then simply syncing it to your [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com) account.  I have found this app to be the most helpful when I am sitting in a church service or Sunday School class due to the quick verse finder and the note taking advantages.

The YouVersion Bible app was introduced to my by [Tony Steward](http://www.youversion.com/live/all) of [Lifechurch.tv](http://lifechurch.tv) at a Ministry 2.0 conference here in Pensacola.  This app seeks to create a community around Bible study.  I am able to use this app for my personal devotional time everyday.  It has the added bonus of community that the other apps just don't have.  I'm able to see what other people thought about a specific passage or an application to one of the principles I'm struggling with.

I know I'm missing some.  What Bible apps are you using on you iPad, phone, or computer that has been a great help?

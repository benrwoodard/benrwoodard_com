				![Weak things of this world are strong ](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_0423.jpg)It is hard to comprehend but easy to experience in our culture. The idea that the worldly system is going to naturally believe the things of God are weak is something we need to consider when we begin evaluating the impact a Biblically based teaching will have in our life.
This is not asceticism. That is a form of legalism that taught people to make themselves weak and foolish in order to "suffer" with Christ. Apparently, the self inflicted pain and suffering should add to the grace that Christ provided. This self abasement is not what Paul is referring to here. 

This is in reference to the humility that walking a surrendered Christian life requires in order to experience God's amazing power and love in your life. Humility says that we don't know everything. It also says that He does and we can trust Him with our whole heart.

Keeping these ideas in mind, we can see why Paul begins his book to the Corinthians attempting to provide a path to unity. The first insight is for us as Christians to realize that our source for wisdom and strength is God, not man. We also need to remember that we are influenced by the world all the time and should check ourselves regularly. 

Next steps...

Be like Spider Man and grab a tall glass of water and think about it.

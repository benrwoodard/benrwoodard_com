I recently found this [post](http://churchcrunch.com/10-desktop-apps-for-wordpress-publishing/) in the archives of [ChurchCrunch.com](http://churchcrunch.com) and figured I’d give it a shot. I’m used to going online and logging into my [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) admin panel but that was becoming a time consuming venture since my internet speed had decreased recently. If I’m watching a [Netflix](http://netflix.com) video, searching the web on my iPad and running my laptop then the internet speed seems to drop off of the face of the earth. So I’ve been using…

[Windows Live Writer](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-writer?os=other) *([download it here for free](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-writer?os=other)) for a few weeks and couldn’t be more happy with it. They explain their app well:

> Windows Live Writer makes it easy for anyone to tell stories like a professional blogger. You can create beautiful blog posts, and see what they'll look like online before you publish them to your blog. Plus, you can publish your blog to any of your favorite blog service providers, such as WordPress, Blogger, LiveJournal, and more.

Setup is incredibly easy and the UI is very clean and efficient. I was really surprised to find that it comes with a preview option that actually feeds off of your style sheets and can show you the way your article would look on your blog before you publish it. You can even post date the articles to publish at a future time. I would recommend this desktop app to anyone using a PC and writing articles for a website. Windows really got this one right.

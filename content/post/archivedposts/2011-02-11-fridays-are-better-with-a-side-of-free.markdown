				Many, if not all you, know by now that I'm doing search engine optimization (SEO) for websites.  Today I've started offering a free personalized Page Keyword Analysis Report through [WingspanMarketing.com](http://wingspanmarketing.com).

This report will give you great suggestions on ways you can improve the ranking of one of your pages on your website or blog. If you follow the suggestions it will help them easily hit their goals.

I listed some key characteristics of this report and some other ideas on [WingspanMarketing.com](http://wingspanmarketing.com/get-a-free-page-keyword-analysis-report/) today.  Go check it out and take advantage of it for your church website, business property, or personal blog.

I'm always interested in offering more free stuff.  What are some other SEO reports you would be interested in for your site? Maybe I can work something out with the owner of Wingspan Marketing. :)

				This blog is all about starting from a clean slate.  I thought that by 32 I would have a pretty good idea of what I was suppose do be doing career wise but...
There are a few things that I am sure of.  I have a beautiful, talented, and godly wife.  My three boys keep me on my toes. And I have a God who loves me enough to start with new mercies every day.<!-- more -->
In 2010 I have gone from home owner to renter (Chinese drywall forced us to move out and turn it over to the mortgage company). And from assistant pastor to call center representative.  There are many life lessons I have been able to glean from this time but the one that seems so real to me right now is the amazing love of God that proves and demands His grace.

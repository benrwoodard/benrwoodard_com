I wrote and article the other week for [ChurchDrop](http://churchdrop.com/a-handmade-wooden-ipad-iphone-cover/) about these wodden iPad covers.  My brother in Portland recently started working part time for a small wood working company called [Substrata](http://www.substrata.net/index.html).   I was skeptical of the practicality of having a hand made wood cover for my iPad but the novelty of it intrigued me.  Check these photos out and then head on over to [Churchdrop](http://churchdrop.com/a-handmade-wooden-ipad-iphone-cover/) for more information and leave a comment.

				There is a trust issue we have with online relationships.  This is healthy.  In light of that fact, I feel it is necessary to clear up any misunderstanding I may have with someone before it ever actually causes a conflict. 

Therefore, I wanted to make very clear [my intentions on this blog](http://benrwoodard.com/disclosure/) property.  I understand that there may still arise some conflicts from the content I produce but hopefully having a clearly spelled out [disclosure policy](http://benrwoodard.com/disclosure/) will either prevent or help solve most of them.

This is also a step I wanted to take in order to build up trust.  I intend on being as transparent as possible.  I don't want to try and be sneaky or underhanded, it's too hard.

So [take a look at the policy](http://benrwoodard.com/disclosure/) if you have any questions just leave them in the comments below and I'll try to answer them.

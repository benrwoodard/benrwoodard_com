				[ M2Live](http://www.m2live.org/) did it again.  I was able to take part in the monthly @M2_Live webinar for October.

I wasn’t quite sure what to expect since the topic was on texting but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it really opened up my mind to yet another way to communicate with our Church members and visitors via technology.

I thought @[timschraeder](http://twitter.com/timschraeder) did a great job of explaining some beginner points of interest for those wanting to begin or even consider the option of using text messages in their church.  I don’t know if I will ever use this option at [Burgess Road](http://burgessroad.org) but it is an interesting way of communicating to many of those with cell phones in the congregation.

One unfortunate but probably true comment was made by a viewer in the chat stream that there were probably more cell phones than Bibles in church on any given Sunday.   When you consider the numbers recently put out by PewInternet.org it’s hard to ignore this growing option for many church congregations.


<blockquote>Texting by American adults has increased substantially over the past year, but still does not approach the magnitude of text messages exchanged by adolescents. Some 72% of adult cell phone users send and receive text messages now, up from 65% in September 2009. Fully 87% of teen cell users text. Teens text 50 messages a day on average, five times more than the typical 10 text messages sent and received by adults per day.  [Read the entire article here](http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Cell-Phones-and-American-Adults.aspx)</blockquote>


I am excited to see another option for us to minister to those around us that are so disconnected from regular forms of communication like print.

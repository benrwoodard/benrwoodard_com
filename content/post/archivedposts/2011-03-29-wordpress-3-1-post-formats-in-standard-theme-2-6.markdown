				I learned a little something this weekend about a new feature that Wordpress developed to help bloggers accomplish more in the limited time that we have.  It's called 'Post Formats' and it is a really interesting approach to content development. 

The Wordpress codex (information hub for Wordpress.org) says there are several options to choose from now for styling your blog posts.  For instance, sometimes you need to simply show an interesting quote.  This new option allows you to publish that as a "quote" and not simply another post with " " around it.  Here is an example from my SEO blog ([SEOPorch.com](http://seoporch.com) powered by the new [Standard Theme 2.6](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&c=ib&aff=108079&cl=64302), one of the first Wordpress themes to have this feature included in it's install.

Notice how it gives you that nice clean "quote" look now?  If you wanted to start a normal routine of including great quotes by people this would be a great tool.  As you can see from the first image of my websites admin/post section, there are several options already set and ready to go for you.  

Each post format option design is completely editable by changing some CSS information and maybe an image or two. [Standard Theme ](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&c=ib&aff=108079&cl=64302)again proves they are the best blogging theme by staying ahead of the competition in their integration of Post Formats.

What ways can these new features help you improve your content development on your blogs? I can already think of a few ways this improvement is going to be implemented on my blogs.

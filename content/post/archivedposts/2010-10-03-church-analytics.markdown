I've had the opportunity to monitor the analytics for my church website for a little over two years now. Like most churches [Burgess Road](http://burgessroad.org) does not have a big budget for web development so I used Google Analytics as my main monitoring device. There are many advantages of using Google analytics but ultimately it is a program that is designed to give feedback to the _business_ _world_ and not the unique online property of a church or a non profit. As our church’s online presence has grown and social media interactions have increased so did the need for a robust monitoring device geared towards the unique needs of our church. 




(Enter [Church Analytics](http://churchanalytics.com))

I have been using Church Analytics for the past several weeks and it has proven to be a very useful tool in making specific changes that directly affect our online visitors. Here are a few screen shots that were taken during one of our services. When you review them you’ll realize very quickly that we do not run a huge online campus but it’s a start.




Here is one of the coolest features. You can view real time information about the visitors on your site.







This is a shot of what content is being viewed. The comparison graph is extremely helpful when adjusting if someone can find a certain piece of information like the Bulletin. (I have to work on that) 







Here is a great example of how small of an operation this is. Although it is only one link, it is a big encouragement for our small website. I would have never known that one of our members posted a link to a blog post on their Facebook profile except for this cool feature.













I think the screenshots say a lot about how great this program is. The key to this is the community behind it. The guys at [8bit](http://8bit.io) are great Christian guys with incredible talent. I encourage you to dive in headfirst into Church Analytics and finally see what you aren’t seeing by using Google Analytics.

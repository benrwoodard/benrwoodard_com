				I cannot believe it has been so long since my last post.  Last thing I remember I was planning to go on vacation with my family to Charleston.  I figured it would allow me an opportunity to gain some ground on my article writing.  

Instead of me gaining ground I have slipped back to square one, almost.  What's up with that?  It feels like life has done a roundhouse kick to my forehead.

It is amazing to me to see how something so important (such as this blog has become) can be so easily neglected when things get out of a routine.  The contributing factors of my loss of focus have been valuable to me doing this longterm but very time consuming. 

I am not yet able to fully disclose what I'm up to exactly but it is exciting to think of the possibilities for me and my family.  

Outside of a huge family disaster, what types of things have prevented you from keeping your routine?

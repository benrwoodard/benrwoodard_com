				If there is one thing I'm good at it's cutting corners.  Unfortunately I cut way too many corners around my  security passwords.

Take it, I'm not the webmaster for a multi-million dollar site or anything but I do need to make sure my passwords are as secure as possible.  Here is a neat website that helps you create a very secure password and keep it handy whenever you need it.

All you do is go to the [Password card site](http://passwordcard.org/) and print off your unique grid of random letters and digits.  It prints in the space of a credit card so you can carry it easily with you.

"Hold it!"

I thought we were never suppose to write down our passwords? Isn't it unsafe?  I thought the same thing at first but then I began reading some of the reasoning behind this idea.
	



<blockquote>* It's safer to pick a secure password and write it down than it is to pick an easily guessed password.
> 
	
> * You already protect your wallet with the highest security (I hope)
> 
	
> * If someone does steal your wallet or even the paper the thief will not be able to know for sure what your password is.  There are literally thousands of possibilities on this card.
> </blockquote>






Go check it out and see what you think.  I'd love to hear your concerns or affirmations about the practical security of this idea.

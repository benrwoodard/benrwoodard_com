				My in-laws came down yesterday with some late Christmas presents.  Among the packages was a little box that held one of the greatest accessaries known to man...THE WIRELESS KEYBOARD! (insert echo)

So it's everything that I thought and more.  I had no idea that it would be as easy as it was to sync it up with the iPad, it literraly is a two clicks on the iPad, five keys on the keyboard and DONE.

The keys are incredibly responsive and are much easier to find than my bulky pc keyboard.  This is my first time using an apple keyboard for any length of time so you will have to forgive me on my wonders of simplicity here.  <!-- more -->

One of the best features has to be the arrows.  There are times when I'm editing code where I need to just simply move one or two characters and using my finger to find the exact spot is a little clunky.

Alright, I know the basic features of the keyboard but are there any tricks with the function keys?

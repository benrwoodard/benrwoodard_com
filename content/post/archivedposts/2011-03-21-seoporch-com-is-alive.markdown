				After months of planning and scheming I finally dropped the curtain and launched [my new blog](http://seoporch.com).  It is devoted to explaining Search Engine Optimization and Internet Marketing in a very plain and simple way.  Much like you would hear in a conversation on an old country porch.

[SEOPorch.com](http://seoporch.com) is where i'm going to be explaining what I do for fun and freelance.  Please stop by and see what you think.  I'd love to get your ideas and comments regarding the new design and theme. 

If you're interested in finding out ways of communicating clearly online for the purpose of building online communities and business then your not going to want to miss anything at [SEOPorch.com](http://seoporch.com/subscribe/).

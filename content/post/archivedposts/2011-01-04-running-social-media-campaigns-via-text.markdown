				Alright, I'll say it "I don't have an iPhone, Droid, or a Blackberry".  Infact, I don't even have a smart phone at all.  My phone was bought at Target from the Go Phones section.  It is an amazing LG (pictured in the featured image) with a querty keypad.  First of all let me just say that I am very thankful for what I do have.  Sure I would love to have something more powerful and with web access but for right now this is what I have to work with. Let me also say that it is not uncommon for me to receive 450 texts a day especially when 8BIT is in full speed.  So it is important to learn through experience how to manage your text messaging in box or it will quickly be a hindrance and not a help.

I have found several tricks to allow me to be as active as I am on social networks and email even though I do not find myself infront of my iPad or computer that much throughout the day, usually.  My phone plan consists of one amazing feature that lets me keep up with all my online interactions: $15 Family Text Plan from AT&T.   There are three things that have been a huge help to me that few people ever use but may add to their ability to interact online away from the computer.

1.  Twitter SMS.  I'm not sure how many of you use the SMS features of Twitter but it is very effective in what it does.  Here [is a link to the Twitter mobile faq article](http://support.twitter.com/groups/34-mobile/topics/153-twitter-via-sms/articles/14014-twitter-phone-faqs) in the help center of Twitter that will get you all the information you need.  It covers many of the most asked questions about using Twitter via text.

2.  FaceBook SMS.  This is a cool feature that allows you to get immediate updates when a friend or company updates their status.  I have found that using this feature really allows me to target the more important status updates instead of having to go through hundreds in order to find ones that interest me. Here is a[ fact filled article in the help section](http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=821) of FaceBook that gives answers to many of the questions you may have.

3.  Email SMS.  I never thought this was possible before but receiving email by text is possibly the single greatest thing that prevents me from pushing the envelope and getting internet on my phone.  Here is a [great article that gives all the specifics](http://www.emrupdate.com/blogs/ducknet/archive/2008/11/30/how-to-send-email-text-messages-to-any-cell-phone-for-free-from-your-computer.aspx) for different carriers.  All you need to do is find your specific carrier code and set up a "forward" to that code in your email account.  It will not allow me to send emails but I am able to maintain a good understanding of what is in my inbox.  It has been a great help to know that I do not have to be attached to a computer when I'm waiting on an important email.

In addition to these three options you may also want to check out [TwitPic.com](http://twitpic.com), it works great with uploading photos via text.

With all that being said, I would be lying if I said I wasn't looking forward to the day when I can use my phone outside the walls of the text message but until then I will continue to work with what I have.

What other options are out there for us text-only folks?  I always love to learn new advantages of text messaging so leave me a comment with a link if you can.

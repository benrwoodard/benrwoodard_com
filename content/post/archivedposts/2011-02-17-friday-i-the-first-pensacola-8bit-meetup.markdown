				We are only one day away from [Pensacola's first 8BIT meetup](http://www.meetup.com/8bitnetwork/events/16494056/).  I wanted to encourage anyone in and around Pensacola to join us for some great coffee and web ministry talk.

We are going to meet at the Drowsy Poet coffee shop on Brent Lane next to PCA at about 7:45.  We have no set times but I'm going to have to leave at 9 for a doctors appointment.  Stop on by, I'd love to get a chance to talk for a few minutes.

I have had several people ask me what this is all about so I wanted to take a moment and fill in some details. Kind of my own FAQ.

### What is a [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/8bitnetwork/events/16494056/)?


The "meetup" is simply an informal time to discuss common interests over coffee.  (I think coffee is the key.)  This should help the local community generate a network of individuals who seek to use their talents and skills to encourage one another while building his/her own skill-set.


### Why is it called an **8BIT Meetup**?




[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/8bit-logo.png)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/8bit-logo.png)If you don't know what [8BIT](http://8bit.io/) is you need to check them out.  They are a network of blogs that have a single purpose of resourcing The Church.  As they put it: "We are a community that totally loves the Church and Her Mission to share Jesus Christ.  We also try to not take ourselves too seriously because the internet is a seriously funny place."





### Aren't we just duplicating 8BIT's Idea?


I'm not interested in stealing any ideas off of anyone.  I'm interested in taking the vision that John Saddington ([@tenblogger](http://tentblogger.com)) has developed and applying it to our local level.  I believe this to be the natural "next steps" of 8BIT.  It isn't a competing idea more than it is a completing idea.


### Should I bring my Bible?


While bible study is crucial to a creative's job, we will not be producing a Bible study atmosphere at the meet up.  Our purpose is to meet, talk, network, and challenge one another in the area of web ministry.  In the field of media ministry you have to have a regular dose of discovery or you will become stale and lose your focus.  Let's get together and talk about our passion.


### Giveaways?


That's right!  If you haven't yet seen the [article on ChurchCrunch.com you should check it out](http://churchcrunch.com/are-you-going-to-the-pensacola-florida-8bots-meetup/).  I was just as surprised as the next guy about the prizes.  The three prizes John is giving away is worth way more than a cup of coffee and having to look at my ugly mug on a Friday morning.  Jump over to the article and check out the links to what 8BIT is giving away.  One of the giveaways is [Churchanalytics](http://churchanalytics.com).  This app is incredibly powerful and will change the way you interact with the visitors on your website.

Enough said.  If you are at all interested about ways we can improve our online ministry to our community then you should drop in to the <b>8BIT meetup</b> for a few minutes before work.

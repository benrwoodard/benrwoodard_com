				I've been busy over the last few weeks (to say the least) on a few  projects that will hopefully turn into BIGGER things.  First of all it  has been incredible staying home with my boys, they are fast becoming my  biggest support group on the planet.  Recently though I asked them if  they liked me staying home.  My 6 year old came over to me and gave me a  hug while telling me that he missed mommy being home more. Next, my 3  year old also came over and wrapped his arms around my arm and looked at  me with some hesitation in his eyes but proceeded to simply say "I miss  mommy".  My one year old showed me how he felt when mommy was leaving  for work last night.  He saw her put on her coat,  ran over, grabbed her  leg and began screaming and clinging to her.  I'm not the best child  psychologist but I think that means he wants mommy home.  Finally, my  wife has told me many times that although she loves what she does, she  wants to be with "her boys".<!-- more -->

So, I find myself at a crossroads and hoping for BIG things.  I feel  blessed to have this opportunity to take care of my three boys but at  the same time I know that this situation cannot be maintained in our  lives.  I've got to move on.  Here is a glimpse into what I'm thinking.


<blockquote>I love working and learning about anything web related  (I'm a wanna be nerd).  I've got plenty of experience doing SEO and web  development work to take on small to medium size projects.  So, I've  began sending out resumes and proposals in response to freelance type jobs posted on  Craigslist.  I've also begun to tap into my awesome [twitter community](http://benrwoodard.com/how-do-i-build-community-on-twitter/).
I resurrected [WingspanMarketing.com](http://wingspanmarketing.com) and will launch the [new site](http://wingspanmarketing.com/) in a few days (I hope).  This should become a great resource for sharing  my thoughts on web development and SEO.  My hope is to simply use it as  a hub to share information and gain a few projects from it.  I've begun  to talk more in terms of executing my plans instead of just  speculating.  This is hard, many times it requires me to  wade into unknown territory.  I don't mean that I take on jobs that I'm  not confident I can accomplish but _applying _principles  is different than _learning _those  principles.  My ultimate goal is to work my way into a good paying job  somewhere around Atlanta or Charleston in order to be closer to family.</blockquote>


I have no doubt that with God in control this is not going to be a dull journey but He is a good and kind leader and will ultimately make things bigger than I could ever hope they would be.

I'm sharing this today to document my journey for myself and my kids  but I also want to see what many of you think.  So, What do you think?   Is there something I'm missing?  Some of you have taken or are taking  this same journey, I'd love to learn from your experiences.

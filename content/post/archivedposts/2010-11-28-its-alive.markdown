				It was almost 4 weeks ago that I killed my blog.  I was messing around with my live Wordpress blog when I got curious one night as to what would happen if I changed the root structure.  I found out.  There are several lessons I have learned over the last few weeks that I would like to try and document.  The first lesson has me scratching me head a little.  Before I explain what that lesson is, let me show you how I feel right now…<!-- more -->









Do you remember how you felt when you finally started doing something that you use to do all the time?  I have learned through this self inflicted ordeal that right now blogging is completely necessary for me.  I love it!  This is really strange for me since I have never been one to sit down and write or read much.  It is great how something as simple as blogging has allowed me to learn how to communicate in a concise way so that people who read it can understand my tone, inflection, and main idea.  I'm hoping to continue developing this skill but most importantly I want to learn how to be better at planning, organizing, and executing my life's goals.

For those of you that encouraged me to get my blog back up and running I am truly thankful.

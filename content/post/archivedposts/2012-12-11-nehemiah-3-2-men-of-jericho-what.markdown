				I was looking over the biblical example of project management according to Nehemiah.  If you haven't heard of this story in the Old Testament of the Bible then you are truly missing out.  It is a story that begs the question "What can I do? I'm only a(n) __________." You fill in the blank. This guy was a trusted servant of the king but he was in charge of one thing, the drinks of the king.  That's it.

Well, moving on tot he real reason I wanted to bring this story up.  I was reading through chapter 3 and came across this: "And next unto him builded the men of Jericho."

What?  I though Jericho had been completely obliterated.  Nothing was left alive according to the account in Joshua.  I already hear the critic screaming "See!  It's full of contradictions!"  Not so fast Sherlock.  There was one, Rahab according to Joshua 6:23.  In fact, there was an entire family with her. Her father, mother, and brothers were saved with her.

What is so impressive to me is that about 1000 years after the fall of Jericho (1550 BC) there was a group of men from Jericho that were rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem (445 BC) next to the priests.  They must have been faithful but their faithfulness isn't the focus of why the God mentions it.  God's faithfulness is to every generation!

Scriptures are amazing!

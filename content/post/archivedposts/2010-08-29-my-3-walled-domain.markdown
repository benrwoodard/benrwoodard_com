So I'm sitting in here in my three walled domain with the world behind me and my computer screens, phone, and piles of information in front of me.  That is my world right now.  It's hard not to look back a few times a day and daydream about "what could be".  ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ I have this great job, good co-workers, easygoing manager and pretty  good pay, yet, my mind is always racing of "what could be".   It has  always been a struggle for me to be content with what God has given me  but it has also driven me to do things that I never thought I could do. <!-- more -->Do  you think this is a symptom of not being content or simply a character  quality that drives one to succeed?  What types of thing do you do to  keep striving for the best while living happily in the moment?

				I received an envelope in the mail a few days before Christmas last year.  It was from my dad.  I forgot that the last time he visited, during Thanksgiving, he mentioned he was working on a special present for me and my three siblings.  He was writing about his childhood so that we would know some things about where he was from, what it was like, and how he became who he was.

I know it's bad but I thought for sure this was one of the "those" comments that would not ever really happen.  The cd I held in my hand made me pleasantly surprised.  As soon as I had a chance, I ran into my bedroom and put the disk into the computer and began to read.  It is written in true 'dad' form.  Here is a small glimpse of some of what I'm talking about...

<blockquote>"At birth I weighed 7 pounds, 8 1/2 ounces. Mom and I stayed in the hospital the normal length of time, three days.  Now I must be honest with you, I don't remember this.  But Mother recalls this and I don't doubt her!  I can imagine it was great being born, getting out of that small area and into the big world."</blockquote>


See what I mean?

Dad goes on to talk about some of the things that happened to him while he lived in the different cities around the country.  My grandfather was/is a mathematician that worked for the military and universities around the country.

I'm so excited to be able to have this for myself but I'm even more excited that my three sons will be able to know the godly heritage they have through their grandparents.  My dad was not perfect and he explains that very clearly, but he is a man that my boys can look up to without regret.  I'm glad my father took the time to do this for us.  Now if I can just get my grandparents to relate some of their stories.

Like @meghanmcfarlin on her [blog](http://loquaciouslady.com/2010/12/29/gypsy-lady/), I too wish there was blogging back in the days of our grandparents but since there wasn't we have to rely on them sharing it with us from their mouth or pen.

What are you doing to preserve your family history for your children?  What types of things are you doing personally to record you life's experiences so that your children can learn from them?

				I remember reading a book by R.A. Torrey called Talks To Men back when I had just graduated from college.  In it I found the quote “A river can rise no higher than it’s source”.   I know it is a natural law but it has so many spiritual applications.  One such application is found here in this chapter as it relates to creativity and imagination.

The whole chapter is worthy of repeating but I wanted to highlight a small paragraph that I believe characterized the chapter well. <!-- more -->


<blockquote>So many of us live down to the limit of our hundred million sensory receptors. Call it naturalism. It’s the unwillingness to believe that which cannot be quantified with the five senses. Or we live down to the limit of our hundred trillion synaptic connections. Call it rationalism. It is the inability to conceive of things that do not fit within the logical constraints of our left brain. As a result, our soul shrinks to the size of our senses, and our mind shrinks to the size of our logic. We become sensory and rational beings. And for a season, we love having a god that we can measure and manage with our mind. But there will come a point when sensory things and rational things won’t satisfy your holy curiosity.</blockquote>


LOVE IT!  I don’t consider myself to be artistic and even look to those that have that talent (@alliswell, @jaycaruso) with admiration and awe for their imagination.  What Mark was explaining through several powerful examples, in this chapter, is that we are all creative because our creator is so much bigger than anything we know.  He expresses very clearly that it is a form of worship to imagine things past our own experiences, explanations, or senses.  Therefore, we should be compelled to express our imagination on a regular basis.  There are so many stories of God giving awesome ideas to people for His glory but I never think that it is for me since I don’t consider myself “artistic”.  I’m encouraged to think that although I may not have a great eye for colors or shapes I can still tap into The “source” for all great ideas and imagination.  Mark gives a simple formula that helped stimulate his imagination: Change of Pace + Change of Place = Change of Perspective.  He encourages everyone to step out of the normal routine and into the uncomfortable such as walking in the woods or sitting quietly in a lonely place.  This daily practice of getting away can help you see past your norm and into the imagination that God wants you to think about.  It simply puts to practice the biblical command found in 2 Cor 10:5 which says to “bring into captivity every thought”. 

So I have to ask…What God ideas, that others have had in the past, have influenced you?  What limitations have you placed on God that prevent your imagination from rising higher than your senses?

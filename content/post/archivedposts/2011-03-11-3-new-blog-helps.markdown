				Here are 3 helpful things to keep in mind when developing a new blog idea.  They are simple to understand but can save you a bunch of "recovery" time.

The process of starting a personal and professional blog have many similarities in design but are fundamentally different in purpose. These are three simple considerations I have seen are important to a good and timely launch of a blog, whether personal or professional.

1.  **Narrow down your topic**. I know there are many reasons to start a blog but if you are looking to make the most impact on people through what you write your going to want to nail down a specific niche.  If I walk into a store it's usually because I am looking for something to buy or I am interested in their products.

2.  **Regular blog posts**.  I feel really uncomfortable writing about this since i just got off about a month's worth of slacking on writing anything for this blog but lessons in life come by experience many times.  When I committed to writing an article every day for this blog I knew it would be difficult but it didn't take long to start seeing the advantages of having a regularly scheduled post.

The advantages I have found include **more traffic, more article ideas, and more community involvement.**

3.  **Don't count on tomorrow**.  There is much that can be said about good planning in any area of life but with blogging it can't be said enough.  There are many people (such as me) who saw blogging as a simple automatic outpouring of information.  This may be true for some aspects but it will not sustain a robust blog.

Planning ahead is key to starting a blog.  Sit down and **consider your time constraints, determine your frequency of posts, brainstorm about topics and draft several posts ahead of schedule.**

These are three important areas that are crucial to consider if you are thinking about starting a new blog.

I know there are so many more but what are they?  I'd love to hear what you see as _crucial_ to an effective blog launch?

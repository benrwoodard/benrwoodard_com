				We have a [weekly parenting class](http://parentsare.us) at our church here in Summerville, SC.  Currently, we are learning about AWANA and adopting the same principles that it uses to reach children to our own homes.  This week we covered game time.  

I know, I know..."So what!"

Here is the part that got me.  The games that we play with our kids are fun but the really good games all tend to have one thing in common.  They all help build our imagination.  Possibly the biggest problem with most television and games we watch, they all tend to hand us the things that is usually left to our imagination. 

Games like soccer, football, bowling, golf, chess, scrabble, Wii, Candyland, etc. all build so many good characteristics in our children. If you're like me you totally overlooked the imagination connection.  Sure they help us relate to each other and build strong relationships but on top of all that have you ever considered how it effected our relationship with God? I had never even took the time to consider the spiritual side effect of a good imagination.  

Read Psalm 139: 1-16 and you will find words that can only be imagined.  Somethings are just indescribable in our language because it just doesn't exist.  

God has given each of us some incredible imaginations.  Sometimes, we see the art of imagination out of balance (mental issues) and other times we see it so crippled (wealth and pride) that life becomes bland and hopeless. 

So this season when you hear the Christmas story read from Luke 2 again for the millionth time, try to use your **imagination** and consider how Awesome God truly is.  

What games can you say have the greatest impact on a child's imagination?

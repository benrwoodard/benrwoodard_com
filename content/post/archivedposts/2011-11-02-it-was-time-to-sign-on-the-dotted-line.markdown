				Today I finalized my paperwork for the State of South Carolina and officially became the "managing member" of Wingspan Marketing LLC located in Summerville, SC. WOOHOO!!!

It has been a crazy road so far to get to this point but I believe I'm ready to take this new challenge in my life. I have to say that credit is not do to me or anyone else but my Savior. I would have never made these decisions without Him guiding every step of the way. Sometimes it felt like He was smacking my legs to stay on track while others He seemed to be carrying me on His broad shoulders. Ether way, I just wanted to make sure everyone knew that Wingspan Marketing LLC and every project it produces is only done because of a loving and caring God.

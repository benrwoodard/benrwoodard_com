				Happy Birthday Dad!

Today my dad turns 59!  My dad is the type of man that ran away from home because of the "restricting" rules of my grandparents and joined the Marines.  It may sound like it was a dumb reason but, a he would tell you, it was the best decision of his life.  His experience in the Marines proved to him the type of man he could become.  He has worn many many hats over the years.  His main passion was radio/marketing throughout his career but it was cut short<!-- more --> in the early 90's due to a debilitating disease called MS.  He was the music director for Cedarville College before it was Cedarville University and the music/program director for WFCJ in Dayton, OH.  I remember all the days we would spend at the radio station playing with stuff that we probably shouldn't have been.

Although I have many fond memories of watching my dad at work.  I think the most impressive attribute my father has is that of being a father.  He included us in everything he was into.  Whether it was talking into a microphone for a 30 second spot or folding pizza boxes for a nickle each, he always included his kids.  As a family we like to joke that it was probably the only employees he could afford. Now that I'm a dad I honostly believe it was because he loved us and wanted to include us in his life.

I love calling him when I'm at my wits end with my boys.  I get frustrated when he doesn't tell me exactly what I need to do but he knows there is no quick fix in raising kids.  Although he had a steller career in radio I love the fact that his main passion in life has always been his family.  His continueing support and understanding conversations have really helped in my life's deepest lows.

Love you DAD!  Hope your birthday is filled with many happy moments.

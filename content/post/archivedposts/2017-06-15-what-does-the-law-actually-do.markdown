**There is more to it though.**

The Law did not create Grace. Grace was always there since the Fall of Adam and Eve. Like a good school teacher, the Law shows us what was already in existence by magnifying the nature of something through a series of laws. 

The Law then shows the need for a Saviour by magnification but that need was established in Genesis by Adam and then through Abraham. 

We need to be clothed in God's Righteousness or we are condemned because HE is Holy and Righteous and that demands everything around Him to be the same. Like two magnets that oppose each, God's righteousness pushes away unrighteousness.

But Christ's righteousness is given to us by Grace through Faith just as in the time before the Law.

when this all comes together we can more easily see the purpose of the Law given in Exodus and properly understand it's role in our salvation and explaining it to others.

Help me out, how do you explain the purpose of the Law in salvation?

				A project is made up of several goals which can also be called milestones.  Each milestone is comprised of simple tasks that need completing.

I have to admit that it is exciting to complete a milestone. It's an event that I worked hard to accomplish and is a time to rejoice.  Unfortunately something happens to my drive and passion as I celebrate those small victories.  Everything in me that had caused me to pull the long hours and utilize every minute of the day seems to disappear.

What's up with that?

<!-- more -->I take it, there are several others like me who committed to blogging more regularly this year.  But alas, I slipped off the wagon and within 30 days I slowed my blogging attempts down to a crawl.  I met some of my initial goals and never seemed to take the time to build new ones.

There were certain goals or milestones I had set for me and when those were met I rejoiced but seemed to have not moved on and built off of those victories.

I'm not sure if is a matter of good preplanning or regular evaluation that needs to take place but something has to change or I'm going to be among the millions who quite doing what they committed to do in the new year.

I'm convinced that these projects I set for myself are worth it so I'm gonna figure this out. Maybe you can save me some time.

What do you do in your project management to help you build on the successes of milestones?

Everyday we are reminded of the tragedy and destruction that living in this fallen world brings.  Hopelessness. Finality. Failure.  All of these are characteristics of this world we live in.

Every once in a while though, God gives us a gift of hope and future.  We see the world in a different lens when we concentrate on these gifts.  It becomes a world of possibilities, bright future, and love.    

My 4th "gift" came today in a small package named Caden Allen Woodard.  He was born this morning at 4:35 AM EST.  Surprisingly, he is the runt of our litter, coming in at 7lb 10oz and 19" long.  

Mommy and baby are doing great, tired, but great.  I hope to post more pictures of the other 3 meeting him for the first time. All they knew was that mommy kept calling her belly Caden. :)

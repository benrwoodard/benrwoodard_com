Debbie and I actually got to go out on a date and we didnâ€™t waste the evening. We went to see Narnia: the Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The story line involves the two younger siblings and their annoying cousin. It begins and ends on the seas of Narnia. Lucy and Edmund find themselves in the water being picked up by King Caspian and the crew of the Dawn Treader who are actively seeking to find out what happened to 7 lords of Narnia. The first island they come to yields a mystery that will ultimately lead to one of the most unique and coolest battle scenes in the Narnia series. Here is why I gave it a 5 star rating.

If your like me, when you first heard about this movie you immediatly thought it was an attempt to become a kids Pirates of the Caribbean.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that other than a ship, water, and swords there was no connection in the story line or events that would lead you to that conclusion.  I had heard that the book (which I have yet to read) is the strongest out of the Narnia series on the picture of Christ.  That would be very hard to accomplish since the first one was so clear on the sacrifice of Christ but again this movie had me pleasantly surprised.   The pg rating is very acurate for this movie.  It was pretty intense, like the other Narnia movies, during the battle scenes.  Overall this movie would be great for pre-teens on up.





The struggle between the "old man" and the "new man" are very real in the film and could easily begin a great discussion with someone on the effects of sin in our Christian lives.   I'll leave a majority of the plot and scene descriptions for you to experience in the movie.  I did want to share two parts of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader that had an impact on me though.  Towards the end of the movie King Caspian comes to finally realize some things about his life and says "I've been striving to get back what's been taken instead of enjoying what's been given".   Wow!  This obviously has so many spiritual applications and physical parallels.  Another line that had me wanting to shout was towards the end when Lucy asks Aslan if she will ever come back to Narnia.  She goes on to ask if she will ever see Aslan again. To this, Aslan responds by saying he will always be watching over her.  She questions how and he kindly answers by saying "I am known by a different name in your world but you can know me there.  That is the reason you came to Narnia, so that it would be easier to get to know me in your world."





If you have been wondering whether or not to see this movie, I would say and emphatic YES!





Have you seen it yet?  Are you planing on going to see it?  What did you think about the movie?

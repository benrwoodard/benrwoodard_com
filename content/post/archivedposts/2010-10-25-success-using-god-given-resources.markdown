I’m continuing a study through the book of Joshua on Success in web ministry. Chapter one begins with one simple fact, God wants you to prosper in this life! So what I’d like to do is try to do is see how this relates to web ministry. 




<blockquote>“For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.”

</blockquote>

In chapter two Joshua sends out two men to spy out the city that God's people must conquer before moving into the land that was promised to them. This city was sealed up tighter than a new Apple product at Wal-mart and guarded by some of the top warriors in the world. It seemed impossible to overcome such a huge obstacle at the very start. God, who called them to conquer the land, also provided an incredible resource for the spies to use while in Jericho, Rahab.




It is simple for me to see how this relates to the information we have to obtain in order to enter the realm of web ministry. The languages and codes like PHP, CSS, XHTML, JavaScript…etc. seem so insurmountable. “How can I even begin to understand these scripts so that I can be effective at web ministry?” I'm not saying that you have to know these in order to be effective but being familiar with them can go a long way in properly relating your message to others online.




Like Rahab helping the spies get the information they were looking for, there are so many resources online that can help you accomplish your goals and objectives. Here are a few resources that I have found to be an incredible help to me as in this journey:







  * 


[8bit.io](http://8bit.io) The entire 8bit community online is devoted to the Church reaching others via the web. 





  * 


[Ministry 2.0](http://m2live.org) This allows you to dive in head first and see “web ministry” is actively being defined and used around our country.





  * 


[W3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) This online property is home to anything and everything you could think of on website codes and manipulations.





  * 


[Sermonstudio.net](http://sermonstudio.net/) This is an easy to use resource for presenting video and audio. 





  * 


[Google.com](http://google.com) I know it sounds funny but google has been one of the greatest help for me to find the many blogs that deal with material that I have questions about. 







There are obviously so many more free resources online that can help you but this is a small list that has been a huge help to me over the past few years since I began this adventure. 




I know I missed some. What resources have you been using recently?

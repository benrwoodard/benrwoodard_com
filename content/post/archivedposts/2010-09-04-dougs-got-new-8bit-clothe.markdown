				My iPad (Doug) just got some new fancy clothes and I thought I would share.

By the way, I just learned that I can very easily take a screen-shot of my iPad by holding down the top button and then pushing the round button for a moment.  The screen flashes white and it's done.  Simply go to your photos and there it is.

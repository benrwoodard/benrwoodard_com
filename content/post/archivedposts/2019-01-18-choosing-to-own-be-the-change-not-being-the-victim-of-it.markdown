Let's set the stage a little here.  I'm an emotional eater and when I was a struggling freelancer, I ate a lot of bad stuff.  At the weight I got to, I should have been 8-9 feet tall but I wasn't.  A new job comes along and I start realizing that I'm miserable and want to change.  







24 hour fitness was a mile up the road.  I signed a 30 day trial and began going driving my car to the fitness place.  I did this about a week and then realized I had a bike and could get there more easily and with more effort (the entire point of going to the gym) by riding my bike.  So that is what I did.  I'd leave my bike infront of the garage every night. 







It was bout day 5 of this when I walked out of my house early in the morning, looked at the garage door where I left my bike and didn't see it.  It was STOLEN!!!







I wish I could say I do this everytime but I have to admit I don't.  The thought crossed my mind that I would just run to the fitness center.  At first I was angry but I quickly realized that this was going to be great.  Now I was running 2 miles (up and back) and getting in some weights as well.  







That was it, I was hooked and ended up averaging 20-25 miles a week within a 6 month period after my bike was stolen.  It has physically changed my life.  I hope to meet this theif one day and thank him for his help.  







As I said before, I wish I responded this way and with as much quickness everytime in these type of situations but alas, I don't.  In fact, most times I complain to others around me and bring in the drama.  It's my way of looking for confirmation that I was wronged.  Every once in a while, I'll be sharing my victimization with someone and they'll just look at me weird or have the kindness to call me out on my attitude.  







I must say I appreciate that response from my family and friends.  Maybe not immediately but it doesn't take line and I begin to see clearly why they felt the need to address it with me.







I'm sharing my stolen bike story because I believe I have been sulking over a victim scenario over the last 12 months and it's time to start running.  I'm going to lead the change not play the victim to it or it's nasty brother, no change.







I need to look at my life's challenges and face them as they truly are, my challenges. These are not someone elses responsibility right now. I'm the one who needs to initiate the change. Right or wrong (I'd prefer Right) I am responsible to bring out the change.







My bike was stolen so you'll find me running on the side of the road.

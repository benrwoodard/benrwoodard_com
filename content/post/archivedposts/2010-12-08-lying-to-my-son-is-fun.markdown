				OK, it may sound horrible but it's true.

But wait! Before you start condemning me for being a child hater and a deceiver, the son of the Father of Lies, I would like to try and explain myself.

I guess I really don't need to explain much because almost every parent in the world tells their kids something that isn't true in order to see the child's reaction.  Right?  Here is the verse that has me bugged (and yes, some Bible verses bug me because it was written by a huge God and little me is trying to understand it).<!-- more -->


<blockquote>Exodus 20:16 "thou shalt not bear false witness" (http://read.ly/Exod20.16.NKJV)</blockquote>


My 6 year old (just turned 6) told me the other day what his plan was on Christmas eve in order to see the big man in the red suit.  I know that this will probably be the last Christmas that he says something like that but what harm am I doing by promoting a "false witness" to him and my other boys?  I don't see any side effects but is there such a thing as an innocent lie?  At what point does a myth become a lie?

I'm leaning to the fact that it is just a part of the Christmas season in our culture.  And that I should use it to help develop a spirit of giving in me and my family by presenting a story that shows the epitome of a giving heart.

But, what do you say?  I'm really curious to see what you think.

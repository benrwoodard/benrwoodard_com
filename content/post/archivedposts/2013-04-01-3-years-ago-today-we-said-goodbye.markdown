				It was 3 years ago today that I was forced to say goodbye to a good friend.  It was my first blogging community. At the helm was a kind (atleast I thought he was) and giving blogger named @tomfoolery.  Then on April 1, 2010 I woke up to this horror of a blog post...



<blockquote>"This is the last post for _More Than Useless_. Blogging and commenting have been a lot of fun and I really do enjoy it, but maintaining the current format of this site along with the frequency is challenging.


Over the past few months, I’ve had a number of awesome opportunities arise online and offline – I’m passionate about them and excited for the work I’m going to be doing. To that, I want to make sure that I can give each of them the focus and effort that they deserve.

I’m likely going to reboot the site sometime in the future though it will be much more casual in nature (so maintain the RSS subscription if you’re actually interested).

You can still follow me rambling on about a variety of tomfoolery via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tommcfarlin), contributing more content to the [8BIT Network](http://8bit.io), working to push out more awesomeness for the [Standard Theme](http://standardtheme.com), and focusing on a few other things.

This isn’t an April Fool’s joke. I know, the timing sucks. It never was my thing."</blockquote>



Sometimes the cruelest April fools jokes aren't jokes at all. :(

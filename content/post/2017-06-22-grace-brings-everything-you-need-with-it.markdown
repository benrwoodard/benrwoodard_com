Grace is free for us but only because of the payment that Christ made. And because it was HIM who supplied the payment we have EVERYTHING we need to live a successful God-pleasing life. 

We already know that God sent His Son to redeem the World according to John 3:16. This is not exclusive to our Peace it is essential. 

Along with grace we are _enriched _with everything we need in our lives to glorify God. 

Getting this grace which brings with it peace is not a guessing game that God plays with us. There isn't some great mystery we have to uncover.

Our gifts have been openly given through grace in Christ. There is no secret code or recipe. Their is no algorithm of good works and Christ work mixed with bad works. Grace is free in Christ because He paid the payment we owed and could never pay.

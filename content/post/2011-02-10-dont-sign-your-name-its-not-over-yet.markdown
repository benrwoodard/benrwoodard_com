				By placing my name on a paper that I turned into my teacher at school I was saying that my paper was done.  When I sign my name on a job application I'm able to write with confidence that all the information that I put on the paper was accurate and complete.  

Both of these events require you to do your best and then turn it in with a signature.  There are some things in life that I just can't sign my name on yet to say "I'm finished.Â  I've done my best and that's all I can do."

One of those is being a husband and a father.  I never fooled myself into thinking marriage was going to be easy.  In fact, the main reason I knew it wouldn't be easy is because _I know me_. 

I strive to be a great husband and father but there are so many times I fall flat on my face out of impatience, pride, or carelessness.  Although these natural actions are hurtful to a marriage and cause many unnecessary conflicts, there is a more harming event that** can kill marriage and fatherhood on the spot**. Theoretically **signing your name **saying you've done all you can do. 

When I made my vows I never said I wouldn't mess up but I did say I wouldn't quit on my side of things, and that is what I intend to do.

With every conflict and struggle that I have with my wife and kids I must always ask myself what **_I_** could have done to help prevent or solve the issue.  God established the "family" and set our death as the due date for the paper to be signed saying you've done all you can do.  

"Never Give Up! Never Surrender!"

What are some things you do to evaluate how your doing in your family?

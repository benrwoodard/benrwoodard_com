				Evernote is a personal bookmarking application.  It allows you to save information from webpages, photos, receipts, or anything digital to an onine directory that you organize and manage.  The desktop and mobile applications work seamlessly together with the online database. (View the intro video at the end of the article)

Evernote[ ](http://evernote.com/)has become one of the most crucial apps I am using on a daily basis. It has proven itself to be a very flexible and stable application that can mold to almost any model.  The thing I like most about it is that it _just works._

If you have used Evernote[ ](http://www.evernote.com/)then you probably know that it has some incredible features in it.  I think the best feature is it's versatility in organizing content.  If you haven't had the chance to check it out yet you really should [give it a try](http://www.evernote.com/).

My intention for this article is not to give  a list of features Evernote has but to show you some practical applications to several different job types.  Here is a list of four I have had experience in.

  * **College **- I use to love collecting information in the college library.  My favorite times during college was when I was compiling information for a big report or something.  I always ended up spending money for copies or painstakingly writing everything down on 3x5 cards.  Having Evernote in college would have made my life so much easier and reports would much more thorough since I would have been able to take more time on research.



	
  * **[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/call-center-287x300.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/call-center.jpg)Bank Call Center **- As with any call  center job, there is a huge knowledge base that must be mastered before one can become accomplished at this job.  I had four huge notebooks of information that i would leaf through when I was looking for an answer.  I can only imagine how much simpler my life would have been if I could have just searched for it among categorized articles.



	
  * **Youth Pastor** - While collecting information that I would use in my sermons I would utilize a moleskin notebook for all my notes.  For a while I tried to have a different notebook for different areas of my life but I soon found that losing a notebook was not acceptable but happened often.  It would have been so nice to be able to collect all of my data and keep it in one nice spot.  This would allow me to better document my findings and make my sermons more reliable.



	
  * **SEO - Search Engine Optimization **- Some of you know that I love working with SEO and have been moving toward that as a career.  Much of what I do is research current trends and techniques.  This takes time and recall-ability.  Both, time and recall, are expedited by a good filling system.  EverNote provides that system by integrating plugins and add ons into many of the major browsers.


[Tentblogger did [a great post on using Evernote to ideate](http://tentblogger.com/evernote/).  You might want to check it out.]

Just in case you're new to Evernote, here's a quick introduction.


This is only a very small sampling of four of the jobs I think would benefit from using [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/).  The simple fact is that Evernote just works.

What other job types would Evernote _work _in?

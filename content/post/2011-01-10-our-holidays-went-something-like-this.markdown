				...minus the party.  
We were privileged to have both our sets of parents down this past holiday season.  One came in during Thanksgiving and and one during Christmas.  It was great to share our boys with them but I know they felt like they were in the middle of a hurricane when all three were at the top of their game.  

It was also the first time that I was home and totally focused (I had no where to go) on the boys for two weeks without school to break things up.  We built many memories, some I want to forget but probably never will (stomach bug). 
Here is a commercial that says a lot of how it went: <!-- more -->

What cool memories did y'all make during the Holiday Season?

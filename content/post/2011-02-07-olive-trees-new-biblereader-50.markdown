				Olive Tree's BibleReader 5.0 is out!  When I turned on my iPad and brought up my Bible from [Olive Tree](http://www.olivetree.com/learningcenter/br5/) during Church I was surprised.  It just wasn't the same.  I finally upgraded all of my apps and therefore got the newly released BibleReader 5.0.

There are few Bible apps out there that can compare to the elegance and practicality of Olive Tree's app.

[I've [compared the best Bible apps for the iPad](http://benrwoodard.com/which-ipad-bible-app-is-best/) before so if you're looking for some options you might want to check that out.]

<!-- more -->There are some great changes to the app but one of the first changes I noticed was that new soft colors.  As you can see from the picture, it now has a soft light tan background that seems to help me concentrate on the words better.

Here is a short intro video into the new features of BibleReader 5.0


It is great to see such huge improvements to this app.  Olive Tree is putting out some great stuff for the iPad.  if you haven't had a chance to check it out you should.

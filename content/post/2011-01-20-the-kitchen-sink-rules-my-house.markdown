				This is the first post of a series on what I'm calling **"Single Focus Project Management"**
Even if you never clean a kitchen sink in your life your going to be able to relate to this principle of life. I'm going on two weeks of keeping my kitchen sink spotless.  Not just well managed but completely free of dishes and junk that seems to accumulate very quickly on an hourly basis in our house.  The last 11 days have been a breathe of fresh air for me and the rest of the house.  Here is why:

Keeping the sink clean turned out to be the link that I can use to manage the whole house.  It's almost as if a line of dominoes keeps falling into place each time I rinse the sink.
After day two I could already see results around the house.  My countertops remained open, free from all the clutter of the day.  I was always able to find the right knife or cooking utensil.  After preparing dinner it was easy to look into the cupboard and find the dishes I was wanting to use to serve the children's food on.  My morning routine of scrambling to clean the table and highchair were changed to calm prepared events.  The dining room table was clean or able to be cleaned easily.  Even the living room was more open and clean of toys or booby traps (my children only use a small number of their toys, the rest they lay on the floor in strategic places so that mommy or daddy will hurt their feet on).  I was even able to enjoy times of reading and play during the day when before I was overwhelmed with things that "had" to be done.  
How is this possible?  Thanks for asking.  It seems to be a principle in life that can be applied to any project or goal.  In the daily tasks of running the house there are specific jobs that have to be accomplished.  Each job requires certain tools to be used.  When I listed what my tasks were and the tools I used to accomplish the task, there ended up being one common denominator among them and that ended up being the kitchen sink.
I am currently testing this principle out in other areas of life.  So far I'm finding this type of project management to be very effective.  

What do you think are some other "projects" this strategy work well with?

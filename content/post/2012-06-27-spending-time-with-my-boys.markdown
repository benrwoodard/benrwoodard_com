				As much as I complain about having to work from home and get "distracted" all day long.  I love hanging out with my boys.  They are awesome.  The other day I made them promise they would still hang out with me when they are teenagers. 

I know it was a futile effort on my part, but I have to try.  It's not like I'm always gonna be smart and strong.

Here are a few images of our first few weeks of this summer.

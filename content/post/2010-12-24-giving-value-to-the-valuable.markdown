				When I think of all my great memories of Christmas in the past I see that my value system is greatly influenced by what happened during these short two weeks. It is kind of scary to think that my valuable memories usually begin about 5 years old. My 6-year-old is entering a stage in life that will establish what he deems as worthy of his time and effort, not just during the Christmas but for the entire year. I say scary because I didn't really think this thing through for my boy until now. I wish I had thought about this several years ago but I guess it's a better late than never type situation. :) Here are some tough questions I've been asking myself about what value I place on events, things, and people in my life.

<blockquote>1. Am I **all in** when we are together as a family?</blockquote>


When we are together as a family doing something, am I totally focused on what we are doing or am I thinking about the I _next_ big event? Sitting and thinking about this I notice an amazing trend in my life. I seem to always be looking for the bigger and better instead of focusing on what is in the present. With all the unsecured nature in life it seems the best thing to do many times. For my boys to see the value in something we do together **I need to be** **focused** and give my total attention to it.


<blockquote>2. Am I **respecting** what God has given us?</blockquote>


The focus here is not on the latest toy but the everyday items God has given us to use for living. Our cars, furniture, home, and computers would all fit into this category. Just thinking about the last few days I can recall several times that I talk down the items God has so graciously given to me and my family to serve Him with. My son (Ryan) recently came home after a gift exchange at school and reported in an embarrassed sort of way that the gift we gave the other child was not received in a very happy sort of way. Ryan's response to me was I told you he liked Star Wars! Unfortunately, I can see many times I have responded the same way as that kid at school. I call things junk or express my desire for the better thing. For the sake of my boys seeing value in the things God has provided **I need to be** **grateful** for even the smallest tool God has allowed us to have.


<blockquote>3. Am I **giving** to those around me?</blockquote>


The way I see it we mainly give gifts to others for one of two reasons: either we feel like it is expected or we feel they warrant a gift because of their service or special deeds. Neither of these yields serious value in the eyes of a six-year-old. It doesn't take long to see the end result of establishing this as the value system of people in our lives. I understand that there are times we should give gifts for these reasons, but, in order to ascribe true value to people in our lives we must give gifts for the same reason we were given the _ultimate gift_, out of LOVE. Love doesn't respond to someone because it feels obligated, nor does it give because the recipient deserves it. Love gives out of a consideration for that person as a person. In order to show the value of people in my life to my boys **I need to consider** the people God has placed in my life.

I believe that if I'm focused, grateful, and giving during this awesome season then it will have incredible influence on my sons value system. These three questions have really given me an incredible insight into what I show my children should be valued.

What other questions should I be asking in order to help my children see the value in what is valuable?

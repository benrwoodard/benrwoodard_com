				Technology has become a part of ministry. On the one side you have the software ministry that makes little of the real effects of technology in local church ministry and on the other you have the ones who refuse to accept that our global-local communication ability has become apart of our culture. In the middle you find the calling of the local church to utilize the best opportunities to reach out and impact our culture.

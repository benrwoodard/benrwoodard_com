				Many of you know I started really trying to get my freelance SEO business ([Wingspan Marketing](http://wingspanmarketing.com/new-simple-mission-statement/)) up and running this last December.  

It is fun to be able to blog about different things in SEO that I find interesting.  

I didn't set any traffic goals but I saw something rather embarrassing on the analytics that I thought would be interesting.  I shared it on [WingspanMarketing.com](http://wp.me/p1iKFf-6W).

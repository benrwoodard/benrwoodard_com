				Do you remember being at recess and having one of the boys next to you say "What are you waiting for?"  This was usually the extra nudge someone (maybe you) needed to do something stupid or awesome.

How about this: "What's the worst that can happen?"  There's a phrase that has gotten many a kid in trouble at school.  

Both of these phrases and so many more like them are used everyday by people trying to persuade someone else to do something that they themselves won't.  They have a good excuse. I've caught myself saying it recently to myself.

Funny thing is, I always have a good excuse for why I'm not doing something at 100%.  Excuses are easy to come by.  They are worth nothing but the hot air they are said with.  I'm rethinking some things today based on the question "What are you waiting for?"

I want to be "all in" before it becomes too late and I regret not taking advantage of something awesome in my life.  

I was waiting for more time and money to pursue several things. If I had waited for marriage or kids in the same way I've been waiting for these things, I'd be a lonely guy.

Take advantage of what you've been given today.  Don't wait till the environment, atmosphere, weather, and schedule line up perfectly. Get in there and DO IT!

What are you waiting for?!

P.S. I have no clue who Gwen Stefani is, nor have I heard her song.  My blog title was just fitting for the topic at hand.  I always Google my page title just to check.

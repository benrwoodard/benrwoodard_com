				I was on my way to a birthday party on Saturday and wanted to stop by and redeem my coupon for a free coffee at Starbucks.  I pulled up to the window to get my coffee when I saw this unique way of asking for tips.  

I was immediately faced with the question of choosing a team to back if I wanted to leave a tip.

As far as response goes, do you think this would this cause a positive return or limit the normal response by people like me, who don't want to choose a team?

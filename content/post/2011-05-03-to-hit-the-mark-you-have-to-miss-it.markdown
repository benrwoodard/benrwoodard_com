I was outside with son#2 when I set up challenge for myself. I told Matthew I was going to pitch a golf ball into the cup holder of a lawn chair from about 10 feet.


Impossible? Nope, the hole is bigger than the golf ball and I have had similar luck from 137 yards. I knew all it would take is some trial and error and plenty of chances.
I began to think of the similarities between setting little challenges and setting life goals. I don't know too many people who live life like they achieve success 100% of the time. On the other hand, I do know many of the same people (including myself) who expect it that much. Maybe you know exactly how I feel then. Like when I think I have failed because something didn't turn out like I thought it should.

This is so big for me. We learn in life either by experience or by lesson. Both of which require _failure _in order to learn.

The idea of learning from my mistakes isn't new to me, the thought of winning from my mistakes was.

There are two things that hit me while thinking about this. They are two essential ingredients that go into success: fun and failure.

From what I can see, in order to succeed at something we should enjoy doing 'it' and we should work hard at learning from mistakes.

It may be simple but it takes a God given calling to to be passionate and determined in most jobs.

Just sayin.

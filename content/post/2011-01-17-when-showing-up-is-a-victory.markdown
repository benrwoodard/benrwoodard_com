				Sometimes the hardest part of accomplishing a goal is simply not quitting.  Life gets overwhelming very quickly.  One story in scripture that has meant the most to me in times of major events is found in 1 Kings 18.  Elijah, a prophet of God, is brought to his knees in self pity and feelings of being overwhelmed.  At one point he asks for God to take his life. 

By nature we humans can become overwhelmed in a situation and begin to withdraw.  We call this withdrawal 'depression'.

(Clarification: I'm not referring to clinical depression that is brought on by a chemical imbalance.)  When this feeling comes on you like dark clouds on a cold winter day, you have to convince yourself that accomplishing "great" things is not your goal.  Set your goal at the first step...Show Up.  

That's it.  A victory is had when you arrive at the starting point.  You can pull back from heading things up, withdraw from speaking in public, even take yourself out of leadership but don't stop showing up.  

Elijah was running away from where he was suppose to be.  God reminded him in a powerful and yet quiet way that he wasn't done yet.  God had great things planned and He wanted to use Elijah to do it.  The same encouragement comes from our God today.  Don't retreat, don't quit.  When you show up you have achieved a victory.  It's a victory because this is when you begin to rely on something other than yourself to accomplish the goal.  

In life's most desperate situations, Show Up and count it as a victory.

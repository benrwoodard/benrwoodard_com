				There are certain times in life where something so simple is just overlooked by the wisest and smartest of us all. Following an extremely simple command can make a world of difference in life.  Here is a short list of phrases I have learned can make or break a situation.
<!-- more -->
	
* Keep your head down (golf)

	
* Keep your eye on the ball (baseball)

	
* Two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time (driving)

	
* Breath deep (anger management)

	
* Please and Thankyou (everywhere)

	
* Brush your teeth (daily)

	
* Lock your knees (giving a speech in speech class)

	
* Spelling is important (highschool handmade V-day cards - 'sweat' instead of 'sweet', not good)
This is a very short list.  Do you have any little phrase that has helped you stay out of trouble or get into great situations, like a job or a wife?

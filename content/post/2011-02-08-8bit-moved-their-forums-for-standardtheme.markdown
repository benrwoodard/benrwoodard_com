				This is one of those moments that your going to remember where you were when you heard the news.  The 8BIT network has moved their [StandardTheme ](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&c=ib&aff=108079&cl=64302)forums to ZenDesk from vBulletin.

I knew that the Standard Theme's popularity as the premiere blogging theme on WordPress was growing rapidly but I never really considered the impact such growth could have on the forum systm until I spoke briefly with Chris Ames (@dewde) via email.  Here is what he said about the move:

<!-- more -->


<blockquote>ZenDesk is pricey for where we are in our org's lifespan. But we are glad to be moving the server maintenance and upkeep over to someone else so we can focus on supporting our customers. We think this alone will help it pay for itself in short order.
Happy customers brag on you and create new customers.</blockquote>

The move allows for us in the community of the [StandardTheme ](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&c=ib&aff=108079&cl=64302) and [LiveTheme](http://livetheme.tv) to grow without any fear of maxing out the server's resources.  As Chris said, they are able to "focus on supporting... customers."

This is one of the biggest reasons I recommend to everyone the products [8BIT ](http://8bit.io)puts out.  The community that surrounds the development of these premium themes has grown into a gleaming treasure chest of knowledge.

There are several key features that will be added in addition to the more stable server aspects of ZenDesk.  Here is a short list of a few of the *new* features the new support license forum touts:

* **A new "help button"** that is a cross between the little red number ticket system you find at Target during the holidays and the digital timer you see at the drive thru window that shows you how long you had to wait.  It means they can see us coming a mile away and get the best answer to us the quickest.

* **Backend quality checker** that tells the 8BIT team how they are doing and where they need to add support.

* Added feature that allows the team to** mark an answer as "You're Right!"**.  Something a husband should never plan on hearing from his wife, but now you can be told everyday you give a right answer.

* It turns the forum into a democratic election of sorts.  As the community sees good answers they are **able to "vote" them up to the top**.[![](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/voting-1-150x150.jpg)](http://benrwoodard.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/voting-1.jpg)

* A **formal "how to" manual**.  I for one _don't need no stinkin' manual_ unless I break something.  Unfortunately, I break the interwebs all too often.  This allows us to get our site back up and running after trying to "fix" it ourselves.

Overall I think this move is going to help advance the world domination plans that 8BIT has.  If you're thinking of starting a blog, make sure you check out the features of the [StandardTheme](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&c=ib&aff=108079&cl=64302). Somehow the 8BIT team it just got "Rad" a lot better.

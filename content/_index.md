## About Me

<img style="margin: 10 auto" alt="Woodard Family Photo 2018" src="/./_index_files/2018familyweb.jpeg">

I work on solving big digital problems during the day and in the evenings you can find me cleaning out chicken coops or trimmiong the hoof of one of my goats.  Living a life full of stark contrasts helps me better understand the world I live in.  

If you can put up with the occasional (I'm being very loose with that word) misspelling or grammer mistake and love to solve problems in life and at work, this will be a great place for you to spend some time.

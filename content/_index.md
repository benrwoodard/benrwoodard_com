## About Me
<small><i>I mean, this is my blog so I'm aloud to take the spotlight and go on and on about myself.  If you have a blog then you are welcome to do that as well. Reach out! Let me know where you blog and I'll come and visit and read all about you.</i></small>

I work on solving big digital problems and clean out chicken poop filled coops.  Living a life full of stark contrasts helps me understand the world I live in.  

This is my place to express how I'm vigorously seek understanding *(hopefully in a kind way)*.  

If you can put up with the occasional (being very loose with that term) misspelling or grammer mistake and love to solve problems in life and at work, this might be a great place for you to spend some time.

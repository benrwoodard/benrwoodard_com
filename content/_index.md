## About Me
*I mean, this is my blog so I'm aloud to take the spotlight and go on and on about myself.  If you have a blog then you are welcome to do that as well. Reach out! Let me know where you blog and I'll come and visit and read all about you.*

I work on solving big digital problems and clean out chicken poop filled coops.  It's a life of stark contrasts that adds clarity to a system built by a culture that wants but rarely sacrificially gives.  

I'm vigorously seeking understanding (hopefully in a kind way) in my daily role while trying to compassionatly leading my family.  

If you can put up with the occasionally (being very loose with that term) misspelling and grammer mistake and love learning how to solve big problems in life and at work, this might be a great place for you to spend some time.
